				<div begin="00:00:534.20" end="00:00:538.00">- Perform a seal check to assess adequate fit.</div>
				<div begin="00:00:542.53" end="00:00:548.16">STEP 6: Put on fluid-resistant head and neck covering</div>
				<div begin="00:00:551.66" end="00:00:554.00">- Ensure that the head and neck covering covers all of your</div>
				<div begin="00:00:554.00" end="00:00:559.43">hair and ears, and extends past your neck and shoulders.</div>
				<div begin="00:00:559.43" end="00:00:563.26">- Secure the ties at the back of your head.</div>
				<div begin="00:00:563.26" end="00:00:565.56">The Trained Monitor can help fasten the ties</div>
				<div begin="00:00:565.56" end="00:00:568.23">at the back of your head.</div>
				<div begin="00:00:575.40" end="00:00:577.76">The Trained Monitor verifies that the covering fits</div>

				<div begin="00:00:592.90" end="00:00:597.86">STEP 7: Put on inner gloves</div>
				<div begin="00:00:597.86" end="00:00:600.03">- Ensure that the gloves are durable</div>
				<div begin="00:00:600.03" end="00:00:604.36">and fit appropriately for the task.</div>
				<div begin="00:00:609.20" end="00:00:613.83">- Examine the gloves for intactness and proper fit.</div>
				<div begin="00:00:613.83" end="00:00:617.96">STEP 8: Put on fluid-impermeable gown</div>
				<div begin="00:00:620.06" end="00:00:623.40">- Ensure that the gown is cuffed and long enough to cover</div>
				<div begin="00:00:623.40" end="00:00:627.23">from your neck to below your foot and leg coverings,</div>
				<div begin="00:00:627.23" end="00:00:631.50">and also to your wrists (including sleeves).</div>

				<div begin="00:00:635.36" end="00:00:638.06">If the gown has two sets of waist ties:</div>
				<div begin="00:00:638.06" end="00:00:642.40">Tie the inner tie first, followed by the outer tie,</div>
				<div begin="00:00:642.40" end="00:00:646.03">with edges overlapping to completely cover your clothing,</div>
				<div begin="00:00:646.03" end="00:00:648.10">both front and back.</div>
				<div begin="00:00:649.23" end="00:00:652.10">The Trained Monitor can help fasten the gown at your neck</div>
				<div begin="00:00:652.10" end="00:00:655.63">and waist to ensure that no clothing is visible.</div>
				<div begin="00:00:656.90" end="00:00:659.43">The Trained Monitor ensures that:</div>
				<div begin="00:00:659.43" end="00:00:663.43">- Your inner gloves fit securely under the gown cuffs.</div>
				<div begin="00:00:663.43" end="00:00:665.73">- And the ties of the head and neck covering</div>
				<div begin="00:00:665.73" end="00:00:668.30">are also under the gown.</div>
				<div begin="00:00:669.40" end="00:00:673.13">STEP 9: Put on fluid-impermeable apron</div>
				<div begin="00:00:675.03" end="00:00:677.73">- Don the apron to the front of your body for additional</div>
				<div begin="00:00:677.73" end="00:00:682.83">protection against exposure to patient blood or bodily fluids.</div>
				<div begin="00:00:687.56" end="00:00:691.13">The Trained Monitor ties the apron slightly adjacent to,</div>
				<div begin="00:00:691.13" end="00:00:695.70">but away from, the gown ties to ease doffing.</div>
				<div begin="00:00:695.70" end="00:00:698.76">Do not tie the apron at the front.</div>
				<div begin="00:00:702.16" end="00:00:705.33">STEP 10: Put on faceshield</div>
				<div begin="00:00:707.06" end="00:00:709.50">- Ensure that the faceshield is long enough to prevent</div>
				<div begin="00:00:709.50" end="00:00:712.80">splashing underneath and that it fits over</div>
				<div begin="00:00:712.80" end="00:00:716.46">your prescription eye glasses, if wearing.</div>
				<div begin="00:00:716.46" end="00:00:719.40">- Secure the strap at the back of your head.</div>

				<div begin="00:00:731.90" end="00:00:734.93">STEP 11: Put on outer gloves</div>
				<div begin="00:00:736.26" end="00:00:738.30">- Ensure that the gloves are durable</div>
				<div begin="00:00:738.30" end="00:00:742.76">and fit appropriately for the task.</div>
				<div begin="00:00:742.76" end="00:00:746.90">- Fit them securely over your gown cuffs.</div>
				<div begin="00:00:746.90" end="00:00:748.90">The Trained Monitor can help position the outer</div>
				<div begin="00:00:748.90" end="00:00:751.60">gloves over your gown cuffs.</div>
