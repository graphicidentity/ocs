1
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:03,599
>>Sheryl: My name is Sheryl Burgstahler

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,233
and I direct Accessible Technology Services at the 

3
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:07,999
University of Washington in Seattle.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,766
Our services also reach out to our branch campuses in Bothell and Tacoma.

5
00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:18,599
>>Hadi: My name is Hadi Ranginand I’m a member of the IT Accessibility Team 

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,200
at the University of Washington.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,466
>>Narrator: Hadi’s an accessibility expert, and he's also a user of accessible technology.

8
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:35,099
He uses a refreshable Braille display and screen reading software

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,333
that reads everything on the screen.

10
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:42,033
>>Hadi: I am blind and I use a screen reader program

11
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:45,566
at home and here, everywhere.

12
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:52,099
A screen reader program is software that communicates with the operating system

13
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,133
and conveys the information to me.

14
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:57,633
[screen reader reads fast]

15
00:00:57,633 --> 00:01:00,599
>>Hadi: Even if you are reading as a sighted person,

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,933
you do not read every content at the same speed.

17
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:08,166
Right?Sometimes you have to make a pause and 

18
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:11,799
then review what you have readand then digest the information.

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,966
For us it's the same thing.

20
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:19,699
When we are reading, for example, normal conversation we can read it very fast.

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:27,266
But when we are reading technical content then we go a little slower.

22
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:28,866
We make more pauses.

23
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:30,699
>>Screen reader: Accessible University.One.

24
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,400
>>Hadi: I have slowed down my screen reader program.

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,933
>>Screen reader: Banner.Heading level one graphic Accessible University.

26
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,233
Banner end.

27
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:40,066
>>Hadi: But if it is, for example, about email I can go...

28
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,899
>>Screen reader: Faster faster faster faster faster

29
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,333
[so fast that audio becomes unintelligible].

30
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,633
>>Hadi: I can go that fast.

31
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:50,299
>>Narrator: But it’s not enough for Hadi to have a screen reader.

32
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:57,166
Websites must be designed accessibly in order for the screen readerto provide a full experience of the webpage.

33
00:01:57,166 --> 00:02:08,232
>>Hadi: I would like to show you two pagesthat are visually pretty much consistent, identical.

34
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:15,666
But one of them is accessible.One of them is not accessible.You will see in an inaccessible page how 

35
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:25,699
difficult it iswhen those accessibility features are not present.

36
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,433
>>Hadi: This is the...

37
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:29,099
>>Screen reader: Accessible University

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:35,033
>>Hadi: This is the accessible version ofa fictional university that we have developed here.

39
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:40,566
We call that Accessible University.Here for example, on this accessible page,

40
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:45,866
I can ask my screen reader to show me the major components of the page.

41
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,532
>>Screen reader: Document Regions Dialog.Regions tree view.

42
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,866
>>Hadi: It tells me we have a banner section.

43
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:51,799
>>Screen reader: Main menu navigation

44
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,433
>>Hadi: We have a main menu section...

45
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:54,566
>>Screen reader: Main

46
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:55,666
>>Hadi: And the main body...

47
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:56,766
>>Screen reader: Apply Now form.

48
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:58,466
>>Hadi: There is another region...

49
00:02:58,466 --> 00:02:59,499
>>Screen reader: content information

50
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,233
>>Hadi: and content information which is the same as footer section.

51
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:08,333
So assuming the page has been developed correctly,

52
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:17,999
I have good idea about the major components of the page.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,866
>>Hadi: Let me now go to see this page, the inaccessible version of this page.

54
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:28,699
>>Screen reader: Home Page, Accessible University

55
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:34,300
>>Hadi: This looks pretty much the same as the other one, the accessible version

56
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:40,433
but here when I ask my screen reader to convey the major components...

57
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:42,233
>>Screen reader: No region found

58
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,833
>>Hadi: It said "no region found."

59
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:50,466
So for me, practically, I have to read from top to bottom.

60
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:59,366
If those accessibility features are not present,everything has the same weight.

61
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:03,799
So we do not, there is no way for us to say that

62
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,466
where a major section starts or 

63
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:09,299
where it ends.

64
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:17,266
It is really not just the fact reading the content,it is also about navigation.

65
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:21,232
We have to discover the page

66
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:25,833
and then that is the most time-consuming problem.

67
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:30,533
Once you know where you are, what you are reading,

68
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:37,066
then it is usually fine.

69
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:40,532
But the discovery process or navigation process

70
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:45,366
is the most complicated process in an accessibility field.

71
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:49,799
In order to do it I have to read from top to bottom.

72
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Whereas in the accessible version,I could easily see what the major components were

73
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,866
and then select the desired ones and move to that section quickly.

74
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:05,299
>>Screen reader: Leaving menus. Heading List dialog. Headings List view.

75
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:13,600
>>Hadi: Headings is also a means to get information

76
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:21,100
about the structure of the content.

77
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,033
It gives me a good understanding, a good overview, about

78
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:29,933
the major or minor components of the content.

79
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,733
So I see that here...

80
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:35,633
>>Screen reader: Welcome 2.Featured Stories Slideshow 2.Accessible University 1.

81
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:41,899
>>Hadi: Accessible University itself is a Heading 1 and under that we have...

82
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,266
>>Screen reader: Feature Stories.

83
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:51,732
>>Hadi: Feature Stories, which is Heading 2.It automatically conveys the informationthat this section is a subsection of the 

84
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:54,966
heading above.

85
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:58,966
You know you will see also that overall get an outline

86
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:03,566
of the page and the major sections of that.

87
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:08,066
That is the difference between accessible and inaccessible.

88
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:12,366
>>Sheryl: That screen reader can only access the text that's presented on the screen

89
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:17,332
and so if someone just scans in a document and puts an image up on their website

90
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,366
that screen reader is not going to be able to read that content.

91
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:25,699
And so the web developer in that case needs to know to create all their materials

92
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,600
so that they're accessible to a screen reader, in other words

93
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:34,366
so they can access the text for that screen reader to read it aloud

94
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:36,366
to a person who's blind.

95
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:38,899
>>Screen reader: Enter.Message from.Hi All.

96
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,733
>>Sheryl: It’s essential that people with disabilities

97
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:45,033
have access to assistive technology but that’s not the end of the story.

98
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:48,333
In order for them to be effective users of technology,

99
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:55,333
the technology that other people developlike websites and software and PDF files and so forth

100
00:06:55,333 --> 00:07:01,666
must be designed in such a waythat they can use it with their assistive technology.

101
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:33,366
.
