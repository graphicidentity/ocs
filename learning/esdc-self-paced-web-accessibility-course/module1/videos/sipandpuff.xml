      <p begin="51.85s" id="p1" end="54.3s">Hi, I'm Charlotte and I'm Jared's mom.</p>
      <p begin="54.3s" id="p2" end="56.4s">Jared is an amazing young man.</p>
      <p begin="56.4s" id="p3" end="58.85s">He has a great sense of humor.</p>
      <p begin="58.85s" id="p4" end="61.166s">He loves spending time on the</p>
      <p begin="61.166s" id="p5" end="62.71s">computer and interacting with</p>
      <p begin="62.777s" id="p6" end="64.619s">people around the world and also</p>
      <p begin="64.619s" id="p7" end="66.899s">with us as a family at home.</p>
      <p begin="66.9s" id="p8" end="68.634s">Jared was born with cerebral palsy</p>
      <p begin="68.634s" id="p9" end="70.32s">and it effects him physically</p>
      <p begin="70.32s" id="p10" end="72.196s">but mentally and intellectually,</p>
      <p begin="72.2s" id="p11" end="73.148s">he's very smart.</p>
      <p begin="83.95s" id="p12" end="86.314s">Jared uses a sip and puff</p>
      <p begin="86.314s" id="p13" end="87.89s">to access his computer.</p>
      <p begin="87.89s" id="p14" end="90.146s">The sip and puff sends a</p>
      <p begin="90.146s" id="p15" end="91.65s">signal to Jared's environmental</p>
      <p begin="91.718s" id="p16" end="93.798s">control unit on his wheelchair,</p>
      <p begin="93.8s" id="p17" end="96.944s">which sends a signal to the Tash switch,</p>
      <p begin="96.95s" id="p18" end="99.687s">which sends a signal to the Intellikeys switch.</p>
      <p begin="99.687s" id="p19" end="102.096s">The Intellikeys sends a</p>
      <p begin="102.096s" id="p20" end="104.051s">wireless signal to Jared's computer</p>
      <p begin="104.051s" id="p21" end="106.508s">that controls a software program called</p>
      <p begin="106.51s" id="p22" end="108.495s">Switch XS. Switch XS allows</p>
      <p begin="108.495s" id="p23" end="111.241s">Jared to do anything on his computer</p>
      <p begin="111.241s" id="p24" end="113.985s">by choosing options from a pop up menu</p>
      <p begin="114.06s" id="p25" end="115.88s">that scans through several choices.</p>
      <p begin="115.88s" id="p26" end="118.744s">When he gets to the option he wants,</p>
      <p begin="118.744s" id="p27" end="121.672s">he then uses his sip and puff to</p>
      <p begin="121.672s" id="p28" end="122.92s">make the selection.</p>
      <p begin="122.92s" id="p29" end="124.996s">He can type, control the mouse,</p>
      <p begin="124.996s" id="p30" end="127.399s">and do anything on his computer.</p>
      <p begin="158.87s" id="p31" end="161.09s">When Jared was in elementary school,</p>
      <p begin="161.09s" id="p32" end="163.344s">we started working with the staff at</p>
      <p begin="163.344s" id="p33" end="165.542s">the school to find technology that</p>
      <p begin="165.542s" id="p34" end="167.864s">would help make him successful and</p>
      <p begin="167.864s" id="p35" end="169.866s">also provide a recreational outlet</p>
      <p begin="169.866s" id="p36" end="172.188s">for him in the computer field.</p>
      <p begin="172.19s" id="p37" end="173.995s">Jared's technology has changed overtime.</p>
      <p begin="173.995s" id="p38" end="176.26s">When Jared was in grade school,</p>
      <p begin="176.26s" id="p39" end="178.942s">he used the Leaf switch to</p>
      <p begin="178.942s" id="p40" end="180.283s">access the computer.</p>
      <p begin="180.29s" id="p41" end="182.754s">And then we changed when he was in</p>
      <p begin="182.754s" id="p42" end="184.909s">high school to a Jellybean switch,</p>
      <p begin="184.91s" id="p43" end="186.56s">which he would access by</p>
      <p begin="186.56s" id="p44" end="187.88s">hitting with his head.</p>
      <p begin="187.88s" id="p45" end="190.52s">And now he uses the sip and puff,</p>
      <p begin="190.52s" id="p46" end="193.368s">which has been the best for accuracy for him.</p>
      <p begin="193.368s" id="p47" end="195.798s">Because of his drive to do well,</p>
      <p begin="195.8s" id="p48" end="200.057s">he's able to do what he is today.</p>
      <p begin="200.06s" id="p49" end="203.71s"></p>
