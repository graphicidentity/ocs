      <p begin="8.0s" id="p3" end="13.766s">Our services also reach out to our branch campuses in Bothell and Tacoma.</p>
      <p begin="13.766s" id="p4" end="18.599s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: My name is Hadi Rangin and I’m a member of the IT Accessibility Team</p>
      <p begin="18.6s" id="p5" end="26.2s">at the University of Washington.</p>
      <p begin="26.2s" id="p6" end="31.466s">&gt;&gt;Narrator: Hadi’s an accessibility expert, and he's also a user of accessible technology.</p>
      <p begin="31.466s" id="p7" end="35.099s">He uses a refreshable Braille display and screen reading software</p>
      <p begin="35.1s" id="p8" end="38.333s">that reads everything on the screen.</p>
      <p begin="38.333s" id="p9" end="42.033s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: I am blind and I use a screen reader program</p>
      <p begin="42.033s" id="p10" end="45.566s">at home and here, everywhere.</p>
      <p begin="45.566s" id="p11" end="52.099s">A screen reader program is software that communicates with the operating system</p>
      <p begin="52.1s" id="p12" end="55.133s">and conveys the information to me.</p>
      <p begin="55.133s" id="p13" end="57.633s">[screen reader reads fast]</p>
      <p begin="57.633s" id="p14" end="60.599s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: Even if you are reading as a sighted person,</p>
      <p begin="60.6s" id="p15" end="63.933s">you do not read every content at the same speed.</p>
      <p begin="63.933s" id="p16" end="68.166s">Right? Sometimes you have to make a pause and</p>
      <p begin="68.166s" id="p17" end="71.799s">then review what you have read and then digest the information.</p>
      <p begin="71.8s" id="p18" end="73.966s">For us it's the same thing.</p>
      <p begin="73.966s" id="p19" end="79.699s">When we are reading, for example, normal conversation we can read it very fast.</p>
      <p begin="79.7s" id="p20" end="87.266s">But when we are reading technical content then we go a little slower.</p>
      <p begin="87.266s" id="p21" end="88.866s">We make more pauses.</p>
      <p begin="88.866s" id="p22" end="90.699s">&gt;&gt;Screen reader: Accessible University. One.</p>
      <p begin="90.7s" id="p23" end="93.4s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: I have slowed down my screen reader program.</p>
      <p begin="93.4s" id="p24" end="96.933s">&gt;&gt;Screen reader: Banner. Heading level one graphic Accessible University.</p>
      <p begin="96.933s" id="p25" end="98.233s">Banner end.</p>
      <p begin="98.233s" id="p26" end="100.066s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: But if it is, for example, about email I can go...</p>
      <p begin="100.066s" id="p27" end="101.899s">&gt;&gt;Screen reader: Faster faster faster faster faster</p>
      <p begin="101.9s" id="p28" end="105.333s">[so fast that audio becomes unintelligible].</p>
      <p begin="105.333s" id="p29" end="107.633s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: I can go that fast.</p>
      <p begin="107.633s" id="p30" end="110.299s">&gt;&gt;Narrator: But it’s not enough for Hadi to have a screen reader.</p>
      <p begin="110.3s" id="p31" end="117.166s">Websites must be designed accessibly in order for the screen reader to provide a full experience of the webpage.</p>
      <p begin="117.166s" id="p32" end="128.232s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: I would like to show you two pages that are visually pretty much consistent, identical.</p>
      <p begin="128.233s" id="p33" end="135.666s">But one of them is accessible. One of them is not accessible. You will see in an inaccessible page how</p>
      <p begin="135.666s" id="p34" end="145.699s">difficult it is when those accessibility features are not present.</p>
      <p begin="145.7s" id="p35" end="147.433s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: This is the...</p>
      <p begin="147.433s" id="p36" end="149.099s">&gt;&gt;Screen reader: Accessible University</p>
      <p begin="149.1s" id="p37" end="155.033s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: This is the accessible version of a fictional university that we have developed here.</p>
      <p begin="155.033s" id="p38" end="160.566s">We call that Accessible University. Here for example, on this accessible page,</p>
      <p begin="160.566s" id="p39" end="165.866s">I can ask my screen reader to show me the major components of the page.</p>
      <p begin="165.866s" id="p40" end="168.532s">&gt;&gt;Screen reader: Document Regions Dialog. Regions tree view.</p>
      <p begin="168.533s" id="p41" end="170.866s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: It tells me we have a banner section.</p>
      <p begin="170.866s" id="p42" end="171.799s">&gt;&gt;Screen reader: Main menu navigation</p>
      <p begin="171.8s" id="p43" end="173.433s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: We have a main menu section...</p>
      <p begin="173.433s" id="p44" end="174.566s">&gt;&gt;Screen reader: Main</p>
      <p begin="174.566s" id="p45" end="175.666s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: And the main body...</p>
      <p begin="175.666s" id="p46" end="176.766s">&gt;&gt;Screen reader: Apply Now form.</p>
      <p begin="176.766s" id="p47" end="178.466s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: There is another region...</p>
      <p begin="178.466s" id="p48" end="179.499s">&gt;&gt;Screen reader: content information</p>
      <p begin="179.5s" id="p49" end="184.233s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: and content information which is the same as footer section.</p>
      <p begin="184.233s" id="p50" end="188.333s">So assuming the page has been developed correctly,</p>
      <p begin="188.333s" id="p51" end="197.999s">I have good idea about the major components of the page.</p>
      <p begin="198.0s" id="p52" end="204.866s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: Let me now go to see this page, the inaccessible version of this page.</p>
      <p begin="204.866s" id="p53" end="208.699s">&gt;&gt;Screen reader: Home Page, Accessible University</p>
      <p begin="208.7s" id="p54" end="214.3s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: This looks pretty much the same as the other one, the accessible version</p>
      <p begin="214.3s" id="p55" end="220.433s">but here when I ask my screen reader to convey the major components...</p>
      <p begin="220.433s" id="p56" end="222.233s">&gt;&gt;Screen reader: No region found</p>
      <p begin="222.233s" id="p57" end="223.833s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: It said "no region found."</p>
      <p begin="223.833s" id="p58" end="230.466s">So for me, practically, I have to read from top to bottom.</p>
      <p begin="230.466s" id="p59" end="239.366s">If those accessibility features are not present, everything has the same weight.</p>
      <p begin="239.366s" id="p60" end="243.799s">So we do not, there is no way for us to say that</p>
      <p begin="243.8s" id="p61" end="247.466s">where a major section starts or</p>
      <p begin="247.466s" id="p62" end="249.299s">where it ends.</p>
      <p begin="249.3s" id="p63" end="257.266s">It is really not just the fact reading the content, it is also about navigation.</p>
      <p begin="257.266s" id="p64" end="261.232s">We have to discover the page</p>
      <p begin="261.233s" id="p65" end="265.833s">and then that is the most time-consuming problem.</p>
      <p begin="265.833s" id="p66" end="270.533s">Once you know where you are, what you are reading,</p>
      <p begin="270.533s" id="p67" end="277.066s">then it is usually fine.</p>
      <p begin="277.066s" id="p68" end="280.532s">But the discovery process or navigation process</p>
      <p begin="280.533s" id="p69" end="285.366s">is the most complicated process in an accessibility field.</p>
      <p begin="285.366s" id="p70" end="289.799s">In order to do it I have to read from top to bottom.</p>
      <p begin="289.8s" id="p71" end="295.8s">Whereas in the accessible version, I could easily see what the major components were</p>
      <p begin="295.8s" id="p72" end="302.866s">and then select the desired ones and move to that section quickly.</p>
      <p begin="302.866s" id="p73" end="305.299s">&gt;&gt;Screen reader: Leaving menus. Heading List dialog. Headings List view.</p>
      <p begin="305.3s" id="p74" end="313.6s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: Headings is also a means to get information</p>
      <p begin="313.6s" id="p75" end="321.1s">about the structure of the content.</p>
      <p begin="321.1s" id="p76" end="325.033s">It gives me a good understanding, a good overview, about</p>
      <p begin="325.033s" id="p77" end="329.933s">the major or minor components of the content.</p>
      <p begin="329.933s" id="p78" end="331.733s">So I see that here...</p>
      <p begin="331.733s" id="p79" end="335.633s">&gt;&gt;Screen reader: Welcome 2. Featured Stories Slideshow 2. Accessible University 1.</p>
      <p begin="335.633s" id="p80" end="341.899s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: Accessible University itself is a Heading 1 and under that we have...</p>
      <p begin="341.9s" id="p81" end="345.266s">&gt;&gt;Screen reader: Feature Stories.</p>
      <p begin="345.266s" id="p82" end="351.732s">&gt;&gt;Hadi: Feature Stories, which is Heading 2. It automatically conveys the information that this section is a subsection of the</p>
      <p begin="351.733s" id="p83" end="354.966s">heading above.</p>
      <p begin="354.966s" id="p84" end="358.966s">You know you will see also that overall get an outline</p>
      <p begin="358.966s" id="p85" end="363.566s">of the page and the major sections of that.</p>
      <p begin="363.566s" id="p86" end="368.066s">That is the difference between accessible and inaccessible.</p>
      <p begin="368.066s" id="p87" end="372.366s">&gt;&gt;Sheryl: That screen reader can only access the text that's presented on the screen</p>
      <p begin="372.366s" id="p88" end="377.332s">and so if someone just scans in a document and puts an image up on their website</p>
      <p begin="377.333s" id="p89" end="380.366s">that screen reader is not going to be able to read that content.</p>
      <p begin="380.366s" id="p90" end="385.699s">And so the web developer in that case needs to know to create all their materials</p>
      <p begin="385.7s" id="p91" end="388.6s">so that they're accessible to a screen reader, in other words</p>
      <p begin="388.6s" id="p92" end="394.366s">so they can access the text for that screen reader to read it aloud</p>
      <p begin="394.366s" id="p93" end="396.366s">to a person who's blind.</p>
      <p begin="396.366s" id="p94" end="398.899s">&gt;&gt;Screen reader: Enter. Message from. Hi All.</p>
      <p begin="398.9s" id="p95" end="400.733s">&gt;&gt;Sheryl: It’s essential that people with disabilities</p>
      <p begin="400.733s" id="p96" end="405.033s">have access to assistive technology but that’s not the end of the story.</p>
      <p begin="405.033s" id="p97" end="408.333s">In order for them to be effective users of technology,</p>
      <p begin="408.333s" id="p98" end="415.333s">the technology that other people develop like websites and software and PDF files and so forth</p>
      <p begin="415.333s" id="p99" end="421.666s">must be designed in such a way that they can use it with their assistive technology.</p>
