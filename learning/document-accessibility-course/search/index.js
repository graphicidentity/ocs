 content: "  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines is technical standard document that explains how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Web “content” generally refers to the information in a web page or web application, including: natural information such as text, images, and sounds code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc. WCAG addresses barriers faced by a wide range of people with disabilities, including those with visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive and neurological disabilities. These guidelines also address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile devices. As well, these guidelines will make web content more usable to all users in general. Versions First introduced as version WCAG 1.0 in 1999. WCAG 2.0 standard was released in 2008. The current WCAG 2.1 standard was published in 2018. WCAG 2.2 is scheduled to be completed and published in 2021. All criteria from 2.0 and 2.1 are included in 2.2. WCAG 2.2 has 9 additional criteria WCAG 3.0 draft was published first published on Jan 2021. It introduces new conformance model: bronze, silver and gold. WCAG 2.1 layers of guidance Principles – There are 4 principles that provide the foundation for Web accessibility: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Guidelines - Under each principle are guidelines. The 13 guidelines ensure that content is directly accessible to as many people as possible, and capable of being re-presented in different forms Success criteria - Under each guideline, there are Success criteria that describe what must be achieved to conform to WCAG. Success criteria are written as testable (true or false) statements that are not technology-specific. All Success criteria are important access issues for people with disabilities. Each success criteria is assigned a conformance level A, level AA (better), level AAA (best). There are 50 Level A and AA success criteria in WCAG 2.1. ESDC WCAG conformance level target ESDC is aiming to achieve WCAG 2.1 level AA conformance for internally used websites, web applications, applications and COTS products. WCAG 2.1 at a glance This section provides a paraphrased summary of WCAG 2.1. Perceivable Provide text alternatives for non-text content. Provide captions and other alternatives for multimedia. Create content that can be presented in different ways, including by assistive technologies, without losing meaning. Make it easier for users to see and hear content. Operable Make all functionality available from a keyboard. Give users enough time to read and use content. Do not use content that causes seizures or physical reactions. Help users navigate and find content. Make it easier to use inputs other than keyboard. Understandable Make text readable and understandable. Make content appear and operate in predictable ways. Help users avoid and correct mistakes. Robust Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools.

 content: "  Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) What is ATAG? The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 became W3C recommendation on 24 September 2015 which is now part of the World Wide Web Consortium - Web Accessibility Initiative (W3C-WAI). Authoring tools can help developers and assist users in the creation of accessible web content through proper design standards. What are authoring tools? Authoring tools are software and services used to create web content, including: Software tools for website management like Content management systems (CMS) platforms Tools designed to produce web content (e.g., What-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) HTML, XML editors) Websites that let users add content, such as blogs and wikis Tools that convert documents into web formats (e.g,, word processors) How ATAG and WCAG are inter-related Web developers usually use authoring tools and evaluation tools to create web content. People use web browsers, media players, assistive technologies, or other “user agents” to get and interact with the content. ATAG 2.0 at a glance ATAG 2.0 is divided into two parts. Part A relates to the accessibility of authoring tool user interfaces to authors with disabilities. Part B relates to support by authoring tools for the creation of web content that is more accessible to end users with disabilities. Part A) Make the authoring tool user interface accessible Ensure both web-based and non-web-based functionality is accessible. Editing views are perceivable by making alternative content available to authors Ensure editing views are operable such as keyboard access to authoring features, provide text search of content, help authors avoid flashing content etc. Ensure editing views are understandable by documenting the user interface, including all accessibility features and help authors avoid and correct mistakes. Part B) Support the production of accessible content Ensure that automatically specified content is accessible and is preserved. Ensure content product is accessible by guiding and assisting authors in producing and managing accessible content and templates. Ensure authors are supported in improving the accessibility of existing content by checking and repairing accessibility problems Ensure that the authoring tools promotes proper documentation and integrate features in production of accessible content.

 content: "  Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) WAI-ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, defines a way to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. It especially helps screen reader users and keyboard users with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. WAI-ARIA provides a framework for adding attributes to identify features for user interaction, how they relate to each other, and their current state. With WAI-ARIA, developers can identify different regions of the page to enable screen reader users to easily move between regions. They can also create widgets such as buttons, drop-down lists, carousels, calendar functions, tabs, sliders, disclosures (show/hide), and others. WAI-ARIA 1.2 technical specification, provides features to define accessible user interface elements and to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. The WAI-ARIA technical specification is an occasional reference, for something like the definition of an ARIA attribute. It’s oriented primarily at user agent implementers. ARIA Authoring Practices Guide, recommends approaches to help web application developers make widgets, navigation, and behaviours accessible using WAI-ARIA attributes (roles , states, and properties, described later in the course). The WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices is a commonly-referenced how-to manual with thorough design patterns for widgets, including expected keyboard interaction and behaviour and working examples with complete HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Web Accessibility Toolkit (WET) equivalent widgets The Web Accessibility Toolkit (WET) is an award-winning front-end framework of flexible and themeable templates and reusable components that are accessible, usable, interoperable, mobile friendly and multilingual. WET implements widgets mostly in line with the patterns described in the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices. Always check WET for a widget before designing one from scratch.

 content: "  Blind W3C defines blindness as “substantial uncorrectable loss of vision in both eyes” People who are blind: use screen reading software to convert text into speech and/or braille; navigate the design using the keyboard; either listen to audio description of video or read the transcript; rely on properly coded HTML page structures (like lists, headings and tables) and controls (like links, buttons, and form controls) to read and navigate the design and operate its functionality. Video: Demo of assistive technology – Screen reader Hadi Rangin is an expert user of screen reader software. In this video, he demonstrates the elements of a well-designed web page and how they sound to someone who is blind. Issues discussed include ARIA landmarks, headings, and text content. Transcript - Video: Screen reader >>Sheryl: My name is Sheryl Burgstahler and I direct Accessible Technology Services at the University of Washington in Seattle. Our services also reach out to our branch campuses in Bothell and Tacoma. >>Hadi: My name is Hadi Rangin and I’m a member of the IT Accessibility Team at the University of Washington. >>Narrator: Hadi’s an accessibility expert, and he's also a user of accessible technology. He uses a refreshable Braille display and screen reading software that reads everything on the screen. >>Hadi: I am blind and I use a screen reader program at home and here, everywhere. A screen reader program is software that communicates with the operating system and conveys the information to me. [screen reader reads fast] >>Hadi: Even if you are reading as a sighted person, you do not read every content at the same speed. Right? Sometimes you have to make a pause and then review what you have read and then digest the information. For us it's the same thing. When we are reading, for example, normal conversation we can read it very fast. But when we are reading technical content then we go a little slower. We make more pauses. >>Screen reader: Accessible University. One. >>Hadi: I have slowed down my screen reader program. >>Screen reader: Banner. Heading level one graphic Accessible University. Banner end. >>Hadi: But if it is, for example, about email I can go... >>Screen reader: Faster faster faster faster faster [so fast that audio becomes unintelligible]. >>Hadi: I can go that fast. >>Narrator: But it’s not enough for Hadi to have a screen reader. Websites must be designed accessibly in order for the screen reader to provide a full experience of the webpage. >>Hadi: I would like to show you two pages that are visually pretty much consistent, identical. But one of them is accessible. One of them is not accessible. You will see in an inaccessible page how difficult it is when those accessibility features are not present. >>Hadi: This is the... >>Screen reader: Accessible University >>Hadi: This is the accessible version of a fictional university that we have developed here. We call that Accessible University. Here for example, on this accessible page, I can ask my screen reader to show me the major components of the page. >>Screen reader: Document Regions Dialog. Regions tree view. >>Hadi: It tells me we have a banner section. >>Screen reader: Main menu navigation >>Hadi: We have a main menu section... >>Screen reader: Main >>Hadi: And the main body... >>Screen reader: Apply Now form. >>Hadi: There is another region... >>Screen reader: content information >>Hadi: and content information which is the same as footer section. So assuming the page has been developed correctly, I have good idea about the major components of the page. >>Hadi: Let me now go to see this page, the inaccessible version of this page. >>Screen reader: Home Page, Accessible University >>Hadi: This looks pretty much the same as the other one, the accessible version but here when I ask my screen reader to convey the major components... >>Screen reader: No region found >>Hadi: It said 'no region found.' So for me, practically, I have to read from top to bottom. If those accessibility features are not present, everything has the same weight. So we do not, there is no way for us to say that where a major section starts or where it ends. It is really not just the fact reading the content, it is also about navigation. We have to discover the page and then that is the most time-consuming problem. Once you know where you are, what you are reading, then it is usually fine. But the discovery process or navigation process is the most complicated process in an accessibility field. In order to do it I have to read from top to bottom. Whereas in the accessible version, I could easily see what the major components were and then select the desired ones and move to that section quickly. >>Screen reader: Leaving menus. Heading List dialog. Headings List view. >>Hadi: Headings is also a means to get information about the structure of the content. It gives me a good understanding, a good overview, about the major or minor components of the content. So I see that here... >>Screen reader: Welcome 2. Featured Stories Slideshow 2. Accessible University 1. >>Hadi: Accessible University itself is a Heading 1 and under that we have... >>Screen reader: Feature Stories. >>Hadi: Feature Stories, which is Heading 2. It automatically conveys the information that this section is a subsection of the heading above. You know you will see also that overall get an outline of the page and the major sections of that. That is the difference between accessible and inaccessible. >>Sheryl: That screen reader can only access the text that's presented on the screen and so if someone just scans in a document and puts an image up on their website that screen reader is not going to be able to read that content. And so the web developer in that case needs to know to create all their materials so that they're accessible to a screen reader, in other words so they can access the text for that screen reader to read it aloud to a person who's blind. >>Screen reader: Enter. Message from. Hi All. >>Sheryl: It’s essential that people with disabilities have access to assistive technology but that’s not the end of the story. In order for them to be effective users of technology, the technology that other people develop like websites and software and PDF files and so forth must be designed in such a way that they can use it with their assistive technology.

 content: "  Low vision W3C defines low vision as “poor acuity (vision that is not sharp), tunnel vision (seeing only the middle of the visual field), central field loss (seeing only the edges of the visual field), and clouded vision. Low vision includes people with cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, hemianopia, macular degeneration, retinal detachment, etc. Vision loss can take many forms and it can be mild or quite extreme. For example, consider this image as seen with normal vision: Some people have hypersensitivity to glare: Some people may be colorblind: Some people may see an entire image, but it might be either blurred or clouded: while others might see the center of the image often referred to as tunnel vision And others still might see the edges of the image often called peripheral vision Low contrast causes barriers to interaction, as users may be unable to identify their location on a page, the state of links and controls, read text, or identify the content of images. People with low vision may enlarge text or change fonts, colours and spacing to make content more usable for their needs. People with a restricted field of view may not enlarge text, but benefit from responsive design (to narrow the display), from related information being grouped together, and from labels and controls being positioned closely to one another. Video: Demo of assistive technology – Screen magnification In this video, discover how screen magnification software is used to access the Web, and what Web designers can do to improve access. Transcript - Video: Screen magnification Neal Ewers: Many of you watching this have normal vision. Oh sure, you might have to find your reading glasses if you want to read a good book and you might have to make sure there’s enough light around to see it. But for the most part, many of you see rather well. For others, seeing things clearly isn’t quite so easy. For example, how do people with less than perfect vision use the web? What kind of technology is available? And what can web designers do to make their pages easier to use by people who don’t see quite so clearly. Vision loss can take many forms and it can be mild or quite extreme. For example, some people have hypersensitivity to glare, while others may be colorblind. Some may see an entire image, but it might be either blurred or clouded, while others might see the center of the image often referred to as tunnel vision. And others still might see the edges of the image often called peripheral vision. Hello, my name is Neal Ewers, and I work for the Trace Research and Development Center, which is a part of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I too happen to have a vision condition. I am totally blind. I have my friend John Klatt here today. I’ve asked him to come and talk to us about his specific vision condition, and how he uses technology to access the web. Hi John. It’s good to have you. John Klatt: Hi Neal. Thank you for having me. Neal: Can you begin by telling us a little bit about who you are, and how you do use technology to access the web? John: Sure. I’m a graduate student here at U.W. I’m also employed by the University. I have a form of macular degeneration that has taken a good part of my central vision. And although my visual acuity is below 20/200, I’m usually able to use most printed material such as web pages as long as they’re blown up by a power of four. I can show you briefly how I navigate not only computer technology, but specifically the web. I use a screen enlargement program called ZoomText, and as you can see it enlarges everything on the screen. It makes everything, all of the print nice and big and easy to read. One of the features that I like about ZoomText is that it comes with a couple of different options. One of the problems with having this screen so large is that only a portion of the screen actually fits on to my monitor at one time. Neal: Ooh! John: So it’s very easy to kind of become disoriented or lose track of where I am. Neal: John, the reason I said ooh was the fact that I realized that when you zoom as highly as you can zoom, you must only be able to read one or two or three words at a time and that’s kind of like what happens to me when I use my screen reader which speaks and therefore I only hear one word at a time. So, I would guess that if you had vision low enough to have to have that kind of magnification, it would be really hard to figure out what was on the screen. John: It can become very difficult, especially as the magnification goes up. I can adjust the magnification so that essentially one word or just two numbers are fitting on the screen and in those situations it becomes very disorienting. One of the ways to get around that problem is to simply switch the function of the magnification. This option is actually like a hand held magnifier where only the portion under the magnifying box actually becomes magnified. With this option I can actually see the entire document that I’m working on, or the entire web page that I’m working with, but at the same time I can magnify the pieces that I really need to see. On this page, while I can’t see any of the exact text, I can tell that there’s a column of information on the left, there appears to be a column of more detailed information on the right, and up in the right hand corner it looks like there is something. It could possibly be links. I’m looking for pieces of information that give me context as to what the page is all about. I’m also looking for pieces of information that match the context of the task I’m trying to complete. Neal: John, can you give us an example? John: Sure. A couple of months ago I was doing a research project using human subjects in research and this particular page is one that I came to quite often. There are symbols next to each of these links. And each of these symbols represents a different issue in human subject research. And what I found is, after coming to the page a number of times, I no longer had to start to differentiate between the headings and the descriptions of the headings and the various links. All I needed to do was find the appropriate symbol and click on the link and I could access the page that I wanted. This was a perfect example of how context can actually guide my tasks and can actually facilitate the work that I’m doing. Neal: John, do you use color at all to figure out how to get around a page? John: Yeah, actually color is a pretty important element of the page. On the UW home page up in the right hand corner there’s a list of links, and the top row of links is in red and the row of links right below that is in orange. It’s easy to distinguish between these links. I don’t necessarily confuse them as one. The screen magnifier obviously enlarges the text, but it doesn’t necessarily prevent me from making simple mistakes. I’m still not reading it real clearly, and the simple use of color creates a distinction that is very helpful. Neal: John, you can see color, but there are a number of people who are colorblind. And if for example you went to a page that had stocks, and the green ones were going up and the red ones were going down, you’d be lost. John: Yeah, I certainly would and you are right, I can distinguish the colors and that’s a big help for me. For those people who are color blind, I know that some magnification software comes with different settings that try to accommodate that. They’ll filter in certain colors and filter out certain colors. You can change the background setting, so there are some things that can be done. Neal: What about spacing John? Does the spacing of text and other elements on a page help? John: Yeah it really does. Because of the way the magnification software works, a little extra spacing between lines and a little extra spacing between links actually helps me quite a bit. When pages become too cluttered and there’s too much information packed into a small area, it actually becomes fairly confusing to try to figure out what the text is saying and follow where I am on a page, and honestly sometimes it becomes a little overwhelming. This UW home page actually contains a great deal of information. There are an awful lot of resources and links to other pages. But as you can see there’s a tremendous amount of space. There’s a lot of space between the lines, the print is nice and big even without the magnification software. Things certainly do not look cluttered, and because of that I find it very easy to use. Neal: Do you ever use shapes like blocks of text or boxes or any thing like that to help get around. John: Certainly, shapes are similar to color and space and that they help me understand what’s on the page. Blocks of text, search bars positioned somewhere in the page give me clues as to where to find particular things on the web page. I think that web designers with some careful thought about how they’re using color, shape, and space really help people navigate their task. Neal: I know that your magnification software can speak as well as magnify and it would seem to me that if you were losing a lot of your vision, being able to hear something and see it at the same time would be really helpful. Can you show us how that works? John: Sure. The magnification software that I use has something called the Doc Reader. It will read all of the text on the page and at the same time it will put the text on a ticker at the top of the page so you get a chance to hear it as well as see it. ZoomText Speech Synthesizer: Play button. The University of Wisconsin Madison. UW Search. My UW. Quick links. Timetable. Directories. Employment. Help. News and Events. Events Calendar. UW Madison to require… John: One of the added benefits of having the text go through the ticker is that all of the text becomes standardized. So if the page has text that’s in a lot of different fonts, or different sizes or if it’s in red and difficult to read, as it goes through the ticker it all becomes one size, it becomes a style of font that’s very easy to read, and it’s white text on a black background. Neal: That would seem to be awful easy for lots of people with different conditions like colorblindness to use. Can you use that without having it speak? John: Yes and that’s actually the way I usually use it. Neal: You mentioned font, John and I know that font size and font family are really important and should be things that web developers keep in mind. John: Yeah, I think you’re right and font color and background are also important to me. Neal: Well John, I have to say that you’ve certainly helped me, a person who is totally blind, understand a lot more about what it’s like for you to navigate the web. And if you can show me, a totally blind person, how it is, then you’ve obviously spoken to a lot of other people as well. I really appreciate you being here. John: Thank you for having me. I had a good time.

 content: "  Colour-blind The W3C defines colour blindness as “difficulty distinguishing between colors such as between red and green, or between yellow and blue, and sometimes inability to perceive any color.” Barriers for these users manifest anywhere colour alone communicates meaning. For instance, a form indicating required fields with a red label and no asterisk, or a link using blue without any other visual enhancement (an underline, 3:1 contrast with neighbouring text, border, etc.). In the colour blindness simulation below, the red and green columns of the bar chart are barely distinguishable. The solution here is adding a background pattern, but the bars could also be labelled with visible text.

 content: "  Motor disabilities Motor disabilities can refer to a range of physical experiences. Using a mouse is often not an option. Users may have a temporary inability to use a single hand due to an injury, difficulty using or controlling their hands, little to no motor control of their limbs, or missing limbs/hands. People with motor disabilities often use alternate keyboards or input devices that act as keyboard emulators. Keyboard emulators include speech recognition software, sip and puff device, on-screen keyboards, scanning software and other assistive technologies. It’s important to ensure all functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface. Video: Demo of assistive technology – Sip and puff switch This video demonstrates the Assistive Technology (AT) Sip and Puff Switch. Jared is a young man with cerebral palsy who, with the help of AT, is able to control his entire computer and run his graphic arts business through a sip and puff switch. Transcript - Video: Sip and puff switch Hi, I'm Charlotte and I'm Jared's mom. Jared is an amazing young man. He has a great sense of humor. He loves spending time on the computer and interacting with people around the world and also with us as a family at home. Jared was born with cerebral palsy and it effects him physically but mentally and intellectually, he's very smart. Jared uses a sip and puff to access his computer. The sip and puff sends a signal to Jared's environmental control unit on his wheelchair, which sends a signal to the Tash switch, which sends a signal to the Intellikeys switch. The Intellikeys sends a wireless signal to Jared's computer that controls a software program called Switch XS. Switch XS allows Jared to do anything on his computer by choosing options from a pop up menu that scans through several choices. When he gets to the option he wants, he then uses his sip and puff to make the selection. He can type, control the mouse, and do anything on his computer. When Jared was in elementary school, we started working with the staff at the school to find technology that would help make him successful and also provide a recreational outlet for him in the computer field. Jared's technology has changed overtime. When Jared was in grade school, he used the Leaf switch to access the computer. And then we changed when he was in high school to a Jellybean switch, which he would access by hitting with his head. And now he uses the sip and puff, which has been the best for accuracy for him. Because of his drive to do well, he's able to do what he is today. Source: PACER Center [pacercenter]. (2013, May 14). Assistive Technology in Action - Meet Jared [Video]. YouTube.

 content: "  Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities Cognitive disabilities are by far the most common type of disability. According to the W3C-WAI, cognitive, learning and neurological disabilities affect any part of the nervous system and impact how well people hear, move, see, speak, and understand information. Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities do not necessarily affect the intelligence of a person. Examples of cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) involves difficulty focusing on a single task, focusing for longer periods, or being easily distracted. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (includes “autism,” “Asperger syndrome,” and “Pervasive Developmental Disorder” (PDD))involves impairments of social communication and interaction abilities, and sometimes restricted habits and interests. Intellectual disabilities (sometimes called “learning disabilities” in Europe and some other countries, and “developmental disabilities” in other regions) involves impairments of intelligence, learning more slowly, or difficulty understanding complex concepts. Down syndrome is one among many different causes of intellectual disabilities. Learning disabilitiesis a functional term rather than a medical condition, and is not uniformly defined. In Europe and some other countries, it refers to intellectual disabilities, while in Australia, Canada, the U.S., and some other countries it refers to perceptual disabilities. Mental health disabilities includes anxiety, delirium, depression, paranoia, schizophrenia, and many other disorders. These conditions may cause difficulty focusing on information, processing information, or understanding it. In particular, medication for these disorders may have side effects including blurred vision, hand tremors, and other impairments. Memory impairments involves limited short-term memory, missing long-term memory, or limited ability to recall language. Dementia is one among many different causes of memory impairments. Multiple sclerosis causes damage to nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, and can affect auditory, cognitive, physical, or visual abilities, in particular during relapses. Neurodiversity is a societal rather than medical term to describe the natural diversity in neurocognitive functioning, like gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and disability. Perceptual disabilities (sometimes called “learning disabilities” in Australia, Canada, the U.S., and some other countries) involves difficulty processing auditory, tactile, visual, or other sensory information. This can impact reading (dyslexia), writing (dysgraphia), processing numbers (dyscalculia), or spatial and temporal orientation. Seizure disorders includes different types of epilepsy and migraines, which may be in reaction to visual flickering or audio signals at certain frequencies or patterns. Examples of barriers for people with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities Complex navigation mechanisms and page layouts that are difficult to understand and use. Complex sentences that are difficult to read and unusual words that are difficult to understand. Long passages of text without images, graphs, or other illustrations to highlight the context. Moving, blinking, or flickering content, and background audio that cannot be turned off. Web browsers and media players that do not provide mechanisms to suppress animations and audio. Visual page designs that cannot be adapted using web browser controls or custom style sheets. Designing for cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities People with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities often rely on: Clearly structured content that facilitates overview and orientation. Consistent labeling of forms, buttons, and other content parts. Predictable link targets, functionality, and overall interaction. Different ways of navigating websites, such as hierarchical menu and search. Options to suppress blinking, flickering, flashing, and otherwise distracting content. Simpler text that is supplemented by images, graphs, and other illustrations. The Canada.ca Style Guide requires that externally-facing content have a grade 8 reading level, and internally-facing content have a grade 10 reading level. A measurement tool, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level test, is available in English only in Microsoft Word under the spelling and grammar options. The readability measurement tool www.scolarius.com (in French only) offers a similar metric for French text: a score between 50 and 89 corresponds to the primary level of education, between 90 an 119 at the high school level, 120 and 149 at the college level, from 150 to 189 at the university level. Seizures Rapidly flashing lights or strobe-like effects in video, graphics or animation can cause photo-epileptic seizures in users with photosensitive epilepsy. Also known as convulsions, these are a sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain that can cause physical harm. Flashing lights can trigger a seizure if: Lights flash more than 3 times per second. The flashing content is large enough. WCAG provides a complex formula here, but the rule of thumb is flashing content larger than 21,824 square pixels is problematic. The flashing content has high contrast. WCAG provides another complex formula here, but as an alternative recommends assessing flashing content using a tool such as the Photosensitive Epilepsy Analysis Tool (PEAT). Because users may magnify the page and so enlarge the flashing area, it’s safest to limit the flashing of any size content to no more than three flashes in any 1-second period Designing for seizure disorders Don't include flashing light sequences of 3 times or more per second in videos, animations, or transitions. If you can’t edit the source, don’t use it. ",

 content: "  Keyboard functionality Ensure all page content can be operated through a keyboard. Most actions carried out by a mouse or other pointing device can also be done from the keyboard (e.g., clicking, selecting, moving, sizing). Examples of functionality include: Using physical controls such as links, menus, buttons, and form controls (checkboxes, radio buttons, text input, etc.). Using features like drag and drop, selecting text, resizing regions or bringing up context menus. Performing tasks such as adding or removing an item from a shopping cart or initiating a chat session with a sales representative. The exception is any action that depends on the path of the user’s movement (e.g., free hand drawing such as a signature). Such actions cannot be done from the keyboard. A keyboard user typically presses the Tab key to navigate from interactive component to interactive component—links, buttons, fields for inputting text, etc. When an item is tabbed to, it has keyboard 'focus' and can be activated or manipulated with the keyboard. Other keys, primarily the arrow keys, move focus inside of components that include multiple focusable elements. For instance, after pressing the Tab key to move focus to a radio button in a group, pressing arrow keys moves focus among the radio buttons in the group, and pressing the Tab key moves focus out of the radio group to the next element in the tab sequence. The path that the focus follows when pressing the Tab key is known as the tab sequence or tab ring. Other important keyboard commands: CTRL-L takes focus to the browser’s address field CTRL-W closes a tab CTRL-T opens a new tab Spacebar scrolls down one screen at a time (Shift-Spacebar scrolls up) Spacebar selects radio buttons and checkboxes Enter key activates a link or submits a form Spacebar or Enter key activates a button Use native HTML links and controls When possible, use native HTML links and form controls rather than custom elements. User agents provide the keyboard operation of native HTML links and form controls and map them to an accessibility API. Assistive technologies use the accessibility API to extract and present useful information, such as the role, name, state and value. The standard HTML controls and links: Many types; see Module 6: Forms > Validating common input types. Use the onclick event of anchors and buttons To ensure keyboard users can invoke a scripting function, use native HTML links and buttons with the onclick event. The onclick event of both elements is device independent: it maps to a mouse click and the Enter and Spacebar keys. HTML Code begins Do stuff function doStuff () { alert('Button clicked'); } Code ends A submit button inside a does not require an event handler. In both the following cases, pressing the submit button will submit the parent form without the need for handling the onclick event separately. Here, the form’s onsubmit value triggers validation. HTML Code begins […] Or: Post your reply Code ends Pair mouse event handlers with keyboard event handlers Using both keyboard-specific and mouse-specific events together ensures that content can be operated by a wide range of devices. The following table suggests mouse event handlers to pair with keyboard event handlers: Device handler correspondences Use … … with mousedown keydown mouseup keyup click keypress mouseover focus mouseout blur When using a native HTML button or link, user agents process the click event regardless of whether it was activated with the mouse or the keyboard. It’s not necessary to duplicate this event when adding handlers to natively focusable HTML elements. However, if not using a native button or link, it is necessary to add keypress. Because the keypress event handler reacts to any key, the event handler should first check that the Enter key was pressed before proceeding to handle the event. Otherwise, the event handler will trigger on any key press, even the Tab key to leave the control. If using the ARIA role='button' attribute instead of the native or elements, you will need to both make the element focusable and define event handlers for click and for the Enter and Spacebar keypresses. Good example: Pairing mouse and keyboard events In this example of an image link, the image is changed when the user positions the pointer over the image. To provide keyboard users with a similar experience, the image is also changed when the user tabs to it.

It lacks an equivalent event handler for the Enter key. The onclick event only responds to keyboard input when applied to a native HTML button or link, and this is an element. The image link also lacks a tabindex='0' attribute so doesn’t receive keyboard focus. Finally, the image link lacks the role='link' attribute, which identifies it to assistive technology as a link.

 content: "  Keyboard trap A keyboard trap occurs when a keyboard user can navigate into a component or element on a web page but cannot navigate out. A simple example is a pop-up window (a modal window or lightbox) that doesn’t close when the user presses the Esc key and with a close button that doesn't respond to keyboard. Ensure the user can get in and out of the interactive elements using only the keyboard. Bad example: JavaScript focus() traps the keyboard user This example illustrates the keyboard trap dangers of using the JavaScript focus() method. The form input field here uses the onblur event, which is triggered when focus leaves the element. When the keyboard user presses the Tab key to move focus away from the input field, the onblur event kicks in and sets focus back on the input field, trapping the user. HTML Code begins Last name Code ends Bad example: JavaScript keydown() and event.preventDefault() trap the keyboard user This example illustrates the keyboard trap dangers of a JavaScript key press event. The JavaScript function makes no effort to detect which key has been pressed (it should identify the Enter key), so it will trigger when any key is pressed. Furthermore, the default action associated with any key press is prevented with event.preventDefault(). Consequently, when a user attempts to move focus away from the link by pressing the Tab key, the keydown event fires, the default action of the Tab key (moving focus to the next focusable element) is prevented, focus remains on the link, and a new window opens. The keyboard user is trapped. Even pressing the Ctrl + Alt + Delete keys in Windows to bring up the Task Manager will fail, simply launching more windows in response to the keydown event. The user's computer is hijacked, and unless a colleague or friend can move focus away from the element with a mouse, the user is forced to restart the computer. HTML Code begins Some page Code ends JavaScript Code begins $(document).ready(function(){ $('span.trap').keydown(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); var href = $(this).attr('data-href'); var text = $(this).text(); window.open(href, text); }); }); Code ends ",

 content: "  Focus management with JavaScript-injected content Content added to a page using JavaScript can be in one of two locations: The added content follows the trigger in the DOM. In this case, the focus does not need to be managed. When activated, the triggering control retains focus, and the added content is next in the screen-reader reading order and tab order. The added content can be absolutely positioned via CSS to be elsewhere on the page. The added content does not follow the trigger in the DOM. In this case, the focus must be moved to the added content using the JavaScript focus() method. The target must have the tabindex='-1' attribute to receive focus. Also, the target must have text content or programmatically-determined text via a label, or screen reader users will hear nothing upon arrival.

 content: "  Content on hover or focus Additional content that appears when a user hovers the pointer or moves the keyboard focus to the trigger (e.g. tooltips, pop-ups), often leads to accessibility issues. The user may not have intended to trigger the interaction or know that new content has appeared. It may also interfere with a user’s ability to do a task. Low vision readers using a greatly magnified screen see only a small portion of the screen at a time. Tooltip content can be clipped by their viewports, so these users will need to move their pointer over the additional content to read it. Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true: Dismissible A mechanism (usually the Esc key) is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an input error or does not obscure or replace other content. Hoverable Pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing. Persistent The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid. Content that can be triggered via pointer hover should also be able to be triggered by keyboard focus. This requirement covers content that appear in addition to the triggering component itself. It does not apply to a non-visible component, like a Skip to Main link, that is made visible on keyboard focus (with no additional content other than the trigger becoming visible). Good example: Link content on hover or focus When hovering over or focusing on a link, a content preview for the link appears just above or below that link. Pointer devices can move off the trigger and roam the additional content (pop-up) without the additional content collapsing. In this example, this is achieved by nesting the tooltip in the trigger. Pressing the Esc key dismisses (closes) the additional content. Example begins This is the trigger. And this text gives additional context on the trigger term. Example ends HTML Code begins This is the trigger. And this text gives additional context on the trigger term. Code ends View CSS Code begins [role='tooltip'] { visibility: hidden; padding: 0.5em; background:white; color: black; border:solid black 2px; width:10em; position: absolute; left:0; top:1em; } .a-and-tooltip { position: relative; } Code ends View JavaScript Code begins // trigger and popup inside the same link var parent = document.getElementById('parent'); parent.onmouseover = function() { document.getElementById('popup').style.visibility = 'visible'; } parent.onmouseout = function() { document.getElementById('popup').style.visibility = 'hidden'; } parent.onfocus = function() { document.getElementById('popup').style.visibility = 'visible'; } parent.onblur = function() { document.getElementById('popup').style.visibility = 'hidden'; } // hide when ESC is pressed document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => { if ((e.keyCode || e.which) === 27) document.getElementById('popup').style.visibility = 'hidden'; }); Code ends This example is from WCAG 2.1 Technique SCR39: Making content on focus or hover hoverable, dismissible, and persistent.

 content: "  Pointer cancellation The intent of this requirement is to help users prevent pointer input mistakes. Users can accidently initiate touch or mouse events with unwanted results. It is important to allow users to cancel pointer operations. A single pointer is a pointer input that operates with one point of contact with the screen. This includes single taps and clicks, double-taps and clicks, long presses, and path-based gestures. For functionality that can be operated using a single pointer, at least one of the following is true: No Down-Event The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function. Abort or Undo Completion of the function is on the up-event, and a mechanism is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion. Up Reversal The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event. Essential Completing the function on the down-event is essential. The easiest way to meet this requirement is to use the default behaviour of controls and not override that behaviour with an explicit down-event trigger. The up-event (e.g. onclick or mouseup event) is the default behaviour for most controls in any programming or markup language. Examples No Down-Event Using native onclick event in JavaScript. Using a native button or link in HTML, iOS or Android. Abort or Undo Ensuring the drag-and-drop actions can be cancelled. For example, when using a drag-and-drop action to move an item to a drop target, the user can abort the action after picking up the item by releasing the item outside a drop area. Or by implementing an undo command or a dialog asking for confirmation after the item is dropped onto target. Up Reversal Press-and-hold actions such as where a pop-up appears (or a video plays) when the user presses on an object (down-event), but the pop-up (or video) disappears when the user releases the pointer (up-event). Essential Software keyboard emulators – the expected behaviour is to make letters and numbers appear when the key is pressed (down-event). On screen piano keyboard. ",

 content: "  All functionality accessible via pointer input device All functionality should be accessible via pointer input devices, e.g., via a mouse, a finger on a touch screen, an electronic stylus, or a laser pointer. Write JavaScript event handlers that trigger on both keyboard and mouse click. Generally, if your controls are mouse-accessible with click events, they will be touch-accessible too. Not all touch devices support drag and drop operations and scripted gestures. Scripted gestures won’t work at all if the user is using a screen reader on a touch device; the screen reader itself uses gestures to function and consumes any gestures before they reach the authored content. Consider both drag and drop and scripted gestures optional enhancements that supplement the main click functionality. Some users may not be able to perform path-based or multipoint gestures using a pointer input device. Examples of path-based gestures include swiping and dragging a slider. Examples of multipoint gestures include a two-finger pinch zoom, a split tap where one finger rests on the screen and a second finger taps, or a two- or-three finger tap or swipe. Ensure that your content can be operated without multipoint or path-based gestures. The gestures can be used so long as the functionality can also be operated via a pointer input device method, such as a tap, click, double tap, double click, long press, or click & hold. Examples All functionality can be operated by a single click or tap, double tap, double click, long press, or click & hold. A slider allows the setting of the value of a range via a path-based gesture, i.e., by dragging the slider's thumb control to the desired position and then releasing the finger or mouse. At both ends of the slider, there are redundant buttons to decrease or increase the slider value. A web application supports drag and drop functionality to re-order items in a list. At the end of each list item, there is a redundant pair of icon buttons to move the item up or down the list for re-ordering. A web site includes a map view that supports the multi-point (two finger) pinch gesture for zooming in, and the drag gesture to move the visible area.

 content: "  Overview – Voice input Voice input, also known as speech recognition, translates spoken language into text and computer commands. It’s very useful for people who have difficulty using their hands to operate a mouse or keyboard, including people with mild repetitive stress injuries, people with limited dexterity or muscular control limitations such as tremors, poor coordination, or paralysis, people with arthritis and people missing limbs. Voice input allows users to dictate text into any application such as MS Word, email, web forms and more. Rather than type, users talk into a microphone with the words appearing where the keyboard focus is. When browsing web pages using voice input, users can activate links and buttons, fill out forms, copy and paste text, scroll the screen and perform other functions. Content must be properly designed and coded so that it can be controlled by speech. Generally, pages that allow keyboard interaction and screen reader use are also accessible through voice input. Challenges that people who use speech recognition software face on the web: Lack of keyboard control for all functionality (e.g., a carousel that moves without a pause button, a custom button that lacks a keyboard event) Invisible focus indicators on interactive elements Mismatched visual order and tab order Linked image with mismatched visible text and alternative text Duplicate link text (e.g., Read More) that leads to different places Visible link or button text that's missing from its ARIA label (see Label in name, below) Form controls without programmatically associated labels Hover only menus Small click targets Clickable controls that don’t look clickable ",

 content: "  Dragon Naturally Speaking Dragon Naturally Speaking (Dragon) is the industry-leading voice input software. Example Dragon commands Dragon commands are numerous and allow the user to control the whole computer interface. A subset concerns accessibility. To move focus from one focusable control to the next, the user says “Press Tab”. To activate a control, the user says “Click” followed by the name of the control. Users can access any of the following controls by saying their name: Links Buttons Checkboxes Images (actionable) Radio buttons Text fields List boxes Dragon will click the control once it has a unique match, so users often don’t need to say the entire name. Alternately, users can number all controls and choose a number: Users say one of the following: Show links or Click links Click button Click checkbox Click image Click radio button Click text field Click list box Numbers appear next to all controls of that type: If there is only one control of that type, that control will be clicked. Users say “Choose [number]” to select from the numbered controls. Other common commands enable the user to scroll the page, reload, navigate browser history, undo text entered in input fields, etc. Dragon MouseGrid The Dragon Naturally Speaking MouseGrid allows the user to move the mouse pointer to a specific area. Users summon the MouseGrid by saying “Mouse Grid”, which displays a transparent three-by-three grid over the screen with the sections numbered one through nine. With the MouseGrid on the screen, the user speaks the number they want to focus on. A new three-by-three grid appears in that spot, with the mouse pointer at the center. The user can repeat the process as many times as needed. When the mouse pointer is finally over the control the user wishes to activate, they say “Click”.

Example use cases of live regions include: User receives a Facebook/Twitter notification Stock ticker price increases New chat message is received Progress bar updates Form validation error occurs Shopping cart total updates A sport scoring section updates periodically to reflect game statistics A visible countdown announces once a minute User presses the “next' carousel button to advance a slide (slide content is announced) User sorts a table by name, prompting the announcement “Sorted alphabetically by name'. In this case, the live text may be visually hidden as sighted users don’t need the notification. WAI-ARIA provides four attributes that enable the author to identify live regions and their properties: aria-live, aria-relevant, aria-atomic, and aria-busy. WAI-ARIA also provides five specialized roles for specific types of live regions. ",

As soon as text is injected into the live region, a screen reader will announce it. The live region must be empty on page load or when it’s first added to the DOM. It’s preferable to add the live region on page load, but if adding the live region to the DOM dynamically, it’s best practice to wait at least 2 seconds for the accessibility API to identify it before injecting any text. The aria-live attribute takes three possible values: assertive, polite or off. aria-live='assertive' An assertive announcement interrupts whatever a screen reader is reading. Only use assertive announcements when the user needs immediate feedback. aria-live='polite' A polite announcement is delayed until the screen reader finishes its current sentence or until the user pauses typing. Use the polite value most of the time. aria-live='off' Tells screen readers to temporarily suspend aria-live interruptions. The WAI-ARIA Carousel Carousel (Slide Show or Image Rotator) described in module 12 uses aria-live='off' on the slide container when advancing slides automatically, and aria-live='polite' when the user is manually advancing the slides. This prevents an automatic slideshow’s announcements from overwhelming a screen reader user trying to read the page, and facilitates the reading of a manually-operated slideshow.

 content: "  Special types of live regions role='alert' Use the ARIA alert role to announce important and typically time-sensitive information that requires the user’s immediate attention. Setting role='alert' is equivalent to setting aria-live='assertive' and aria-atomic='true'. The only difference is that some screen readers begin the announcement by saying 'alert', to identify it to users as an alert. Good example: Using role='alert' In this example, a element has a role='alert' attribute and is set via CSS to display: none. Removing the CSS display: none value triggers the live announcement. Exposing such previously-hidden text is equivalent to injecting text. The initial alert has the class name hidden, which hides the alert text with CSS display: none. HTML Code begins Update profile You profile has been updated. Code ends CSS Code begins .hidden { display: none; } Code ends The alert is triggered by removing the CSS class name hidden HTML Code begins Update profile You profile has been updated. Code ends role='status' Use the ARIA status role to announce advisory information to the user that is less urgent than an alert. Setting role='status' is equivalent to setting aria-live='polite' and aria-atomic='true'. If an element on the page controls what appears in the status, assign the controlling element the aria-controls='IDREF' attribute, pointing to the id attribute value of the element with role='status'. Good example: Use role='status' In this example, a paragraph with the role='status' attribute displays the number of items in a shopping cart. Because role='status' by default uses aria-atomic='true', the whole contents of the paragraph are announced. When the count updates, the live announcement kicks in. Screen readers declare the visually-hidden text 'Shopping cart', the revised count, and the word 'items'. The title attribute on the holding the icon provides a visual label for mouse users. Since support for the title attribute is inconsistent across screen readers, the element is hidden from all of them (using the aria-hidden='true' attribute) and the more reliable visually-hidden text is used to label the icon (using the WET CSS class .wb-inv). The aria-controls='IDREF' attribute is set on the button and given the id attribute value of the element holding the role='status' attribute. Example begins Shopping cart 0 items Add to cart Example ends HTML Code begins Shopping cart 0 items Add to cart Code ends View JavaScript Code begins let counter = 0; function buy() { counter += 1; document.getElementById('cart-count').innerHTML = counter; } Code ends View CSS Code begins .wb-inv { clip: rect(1px,1px,1px,1px); height: 1px; margin: 0; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; width: 1px; } .glyphicon { position: relative; top: 2px; display: inline-block; font-family: 'Glyphicons Halflings'; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; line-height: 1; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } .glyphicon-shopping-cart:before { content: '\e116'; } Code ends role='timer' Use the ARIA timer role to identify a numerical counter listing the time elapsed from a starting point or the time remaining until an end point. The role has the implied value of aria-live='off', to prevent frequent announcements from overwhelming the screen reader user. However, you can announce the time at regular intervals by using JavaScript to briefly set the aria-live='assertive' and role='alert' attributes, overruling aria-live='off' and role='timer'. Good example: Countdown announcing at intervals In this example, a countdown uses the role='timer', so is silent in screen readers due to its implicit aria-live='off' setting. HTML Code begins 60 seconds left! However, at 15-second intervals, JavaScript briefly adds the aria-live ='assertive' attribute and replaces the timer role with role='alert'. Screen readers announce the initial alert, “60 seconds left!', then the time remaining every 15 seconds: “45 seconds left!', etc. HTML Code begins 45 seconds left! An interval of 15 seconds between announcements is too brief in practice and is done here simply to illustrate the technique. One minute is a more practical interval. Try visiting the live demo (Opens in new tab) with a screen reader running. View JavaScript Code begins function decrement() { var numElement = document.getElementById('number'); var newNumber = parseInt(numElement.textContent - 1); if (newNumber > -1) { numElement.textContent = newNumber; } if ((newNumber % 15)===0 || newNumber == 0) { setAlert(); } } function setAlert() { var liveRegion = document.getElementById('countdown'); liveRegion.setAttribute('aria-live', 'assertive'); liveRegion.setAttribute('role', 'alert'); setTimeout(function() { liveRegion.removeAttribute('aria-live'); liveRegion.setAttribute('role', 'timer'); }, 999); } window.setInterval(function() { decrement(); }, 1000); window.addEventListener('load', function () { setAlert(); //alert on 60 seconds (or beginning) }); Code ends role='marquee' Use the ARIA marquee role to define an area as a type of live region with non-essential announcements that change frequently. Examples include stock tickers and frequently-changing ad banners. Elements with the marquee role have an implicit aria-live='off'. As with the timer role, the content changes too frequently to announce in screen readers. Screen reader users can still navigate to the area to read the text. A marquee is required to have an accessible name. If a visible label is present use the aria-labelledby attribute; otherwise, use aria-label. role='log' Use the ARIA log role to keep track of sequential updates, such as a chat log, messaging history, game log or an error log. New information is added to the end, old information is optionally removed from the beginning. Updates to the live region are announced when the user is idle. The live region defined by role='log' has implicit aria-live='polite' and aria-atomic='true' attribute values. ",

 content: "  Overview – Time limits Time limits are a potential barrier to people with disabilities such as blindness, low vision, dexterity impairments, and cognitive limitations. These users may require more time to read content or to perform a task such as completing an on-line form. WCAG requires that content with time limits offers one of the following features: Turn off The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it. Adjust The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it to a length at least ten times the default setting. Extend The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit. Any process that happens without user initiation after a set time or on a periodic basis is a time limit. This includes a partial or full update of content (such as a page refresh), changes to content, and the expiration of a window of opportunity for a user to react to a request for input. It also includes content that is updating too fast for the user to read or understand – any animated, moving or scrolling content. Examples: A form with a time limit offers a control that allows the user to turn it off or extend it up to ten times the default. After a period of user inactivity, a client-side script asks if the user needs more time. If it doesn’t get a response within 20 seconds, it times out. A site with a rotating banner offers a control that allows the user to extend the time between updates as much as ten times the default. A site with a rotating banner offers a pause button. A page with animated text that scrolls, appears and fades away offers the user a pause button. With session timeouts, present warning messages in a popup dialog with options for the user to either extend or end the session. (The ARIA Dialog pattern and the WET session timeout are described in module 12.) For timers with fixed deadlines, provide a countdown feature with ARIA live announcements at strategic intervals. See the example in the preceding section, Good example: Countdown announcing at intervals When refreshing/reloading a page, ask the user’s permission. An automatic page refresh/reload can cause difficulties for people with motor impairments, people with low vision, people who are blind, and people with certain cognitive limitations. Screen reader users may not have sufficient time to find their place before the page refreshes again. Instead, notify users that newer content is available and provide the options to update or continue with the old content. If the content update is urgent, use a popup dialog and shift the user’s focus to it; otherwise, use an eye-catching ARIA live region with role='alert'. ",

This is a partial list of structure-defining semantic HTML elements. Others -- such as lists, links, tables, forms and images -- are described elsewhere in this course Articles The HTML5 element represents a complete or self-contained composition in a web page. Examples of articles include an item at a shopping site or a news article on a news site. HTML Code begins Tooth Paste Classic Tooth Paste Extreme Code ends Sections The HTML5 element marks a general region of a web page or an article. It is used for thematic grouping of content and should open with a heading. If the element is named (using aria-label, aria-labelledby or title attribute), it is identified as a Landmark. HTML Code begins Chapter 2 Code ends Paragraphs Use the paragraph element () to markup paragraphs of text, such as this one. The consistent styling of paragraphs improves text readability. It also gives users more control when customizing their view. Quotes Identifying a quotation helps clarify that the content is attributed to another author. Quotes can be marked up as inline or as blocks of text. Assistive technologies can convey to users where a quote starts and ends, which can avoid misunderstandings. Good example: Blockquote Use the element for longer and more complex quotes. It can contain paragraphs, headings, and other text structure elements. Those should reflect the structure of the cited document. The element is used to refer to the source of the quote. Example begins The following is a definition on Page Structure Concept from W3 WAI. Well-structured content allows more efficient navigation and processing. Use HTML and WAI-ARIA to improve navigation and orientation on web pages and in applications. Example ends HTML Code begins The following is a definition on Page Structure Concept from W3 WAI. Well-structured content allows more efficient navigation and processing. Use HTML and WAI-ARIA to improve navigation and orientation on web pages and in applications. Code ends Good example: Inline quote For shorter quotes, that are usually embedded in another sentence, use the element. Example begins Helen Keller said, 'Self-pity is our worst enemy and if we yield to it, we can never do anything good in the world.' Example ends HTML Code begins Helen Keller said, 'Self-pity is our worst enemy and if we yield to it, we can never do anything good in the world.' Code ends Strong (bold) and em (italics) tags STRONG and EM are semantic tags meaning the author wishes to provide emphasis, which is rendered as bold () or italic () on a visual browser. The and elements should not be used. The and elements are often used to highlight words or phrases in a paragraph of text. For example: Example begins 'Important: I would like to be notified by email, not other forms of communication.' 'She was not amused.' Example ends Screen reader support for and is weak.

The title can also appear in site maps, search results and link text. This one piece of information helps all users find content, orient themselves within it, and navigate through it. Best practice for page titles: Ensure each web page defines its topic or purpose in a descriptive title. Set the title in a element in the HTML element. Optionally, identify the larger collection of Web pages after the page description.

However, to be recognizable and navigable to screen reader users, the list must use the appropriate semantic markup. HTML provides three list structures, each with specific semantics: Use unordered lists () when the order of the items is irrelevant. Each list item () in an unordered list is marked with a bullet. Use ordered lists () for sequential information. Each list item () is numbered by the browser. Use description lists () to group related terms () and their descriptions (). Individual list items can contain a variety of HTML elements, including paragraphs, headings, form elements, and other (nested) lists -- any kind of “flow content”. Avoid nesting multiple child elements in each list item, since screen reader users can lose track of the list itself. Unordered lists are commonly used to hold horizontal and vertical menus (for navigation, social media and list of links). Ordered lists are commonly used for breadcrumbs. ",

Validate your markup with a tool such as The W3C Markup Validation Service. Validation reports generally catch each requirement’s defects. The consequences to accessibility range from minimal to severe. Most modern browsers repair incomplete start or end tags, improper nesting and duplicate attributes.

Use clear link text – e.g. “Skip to Main Content” or “Skip to Content” Use a same-page link, targeting the id attribute value of the destination (usually the element). Assign the destination the tabindex='-1' attribute. This fixes shortcomings in some browsers that move the viewport to the destination but not the focus. Do not hide the skip link using any of these CSS options: Use CSS to permanently position the link off screen Set display: none Set visibility: invisible Multiple ways Provide more than one way to locate a Web page within a set of Web pages.

 content: "  Changes of context are predictable When user actions unexpectedly cause a major change to a web page known as a change of context, it can disorient users who aren't able to view the entire page simultaneously or who are easily distracted by changes. Unexpected changes of context impact users with motor impairments, users with low vision who magnify the screen, users who are blind, and users with certain cognitive limitations. A change of context includes changes of: User agent Software that retrieves and presents content, e.g., a Web browser, media player, plug-in or other program including assistive technologies. A completely separate user agent, such as an external viewer programme, opens. Viewport Content is rendered in one or more viewports. These include browser windows, browser tabs, frames, loudspeakers, and virtual magnifying glasses. Typically, a new window opens. Focus Focus refers to which interactive control on the screen -- a link, form control, button, or custom control -- currently receives input from the keyboard (and from the clipboard when you paste content). The user's focus moves unexpectedly to a different part of the current Web page. Content that changes the meaning of the Web page This includes significantly re-arranging the content of a page. As discussed in the following sections, changes of context must never be triggered on focus, and must be anticipated by the user if triggered by changing the setting of a control (on input). ",

 content: "  Link purpose Screen readers enable users to skim links on a page, moving from one to the next without declaring the neighboring text. Whenever possible, provide link text that identifies the purpose of the link without needing additional context. According to the Canada.ca Content Style Guide, “Your links should be descriptive and able to stand alone so that it's clear what people can expect if they click on them.” People with visual disabilities can also determine the purpose of a link by exploring the link's context. If writing stand-alone link text is impossible, ensure the link text identifies its purpose in combination with one of the following: The enclosing sentence The enclosing list item The enclosing paragraph The enclosing table cell and table header cell The parent list item of a nested list (example follows) Do not use information-empty link text such as “click here” or “Read More” etc. If two or more links on the same page have identical link text but different destinations, you can distinguish the links from one another in one of three ways: Rephrase the link text. Use an ARIA label (either the aria-label or aria-labelledby attribute). The ARIA label supercedes the native link text in assistive technology. Be sure to include the visible link text in the ARIA label, so voice input users can target the link (see Link Activation, below). Add visually-hidden text to the link text (example follows). Link vs button Developers frequently confuse the link and button roles, passing the confusion on to screen reader users. Users expect links to navigate (across pages or within a page), and buttons to trigger a local effect (or submit a form). A screen reader user can be disorientated when activating a button and instead navigating to a new page, or when activating a link and instead interpreting a local button effect. Bad example: Vague link text In this example, the link text “how much” communicates nothing useful: Example begins A Food Guide Serving is simply a reference amount. It helps you understand how much food is recommended every day from each of the four food groups. In some cases, a Food Guide Serving may be close to what you eat, such as an apple. In other cases, such as rice or pasta, you may serve yourself more than one Food Guide Serving. Example ends Good example: Descriptive link text In this example, the purpose of the link is perfectly clear. Example begins A Food Guide serving is how much food you should eat from each of the 4 food groups every day. In some cases, a serving is the amount of a given food group that you normally eat in one sitting, like an apple. In other cases, the daily amount is more than one serving, such as for rice or pasta. Number of daily food servings for children, teens and adults Example ends Good example: Using aria-label for link purpose In this example, the visible link text “Access” is repeated for each resource. When there's no avoiding duplicated, visible link text, you can distinguish each instance with the aria-label attribute. HTML Code begins Tools and resources Planning Accessible Virtual Events – Job Aid [Description of the resource] Access Employees with Disabilities Network (EwDN) [Description of the resource] Access Code ends Good example: Using aria-labelledby for link purpose Again, the visible link text “Access” is repeated for each resource. You can distinguish each instance with the aria-labelledby attribute, pointing to one or more id attribute values of elements containing the desired label. In this example, the label concatenates the link text + the preceding heading. Note that one instance of the link text “Access” with an id attribute can be referenced by multiple ARIA labels, which may be more convenient than creating an id attribute for each instance of the link “Access”.

 content: "  Link activation Some people with disabilities are not able to use a mouse and instead leverage mechanisms such as keyboard, voice control and alternative pointing devices to navigate and interact with web. Ensure that links (and buttons and other controls) are focusable and actionable by keyboard and voice input and not just via a mouse. Native links are keyboard-activated by pressing the Enter key. If you design a custom link using the ARIA role='link' attribute and a div or span element, include: A tabindex='0' attribute, so that the custom link receives keyboard focus via the Tab key. A JavaScript event listener for the Enter key for activation, in addition to mouse click. To activate a link using voice input, the user declares the name of the link as visible. When using aria-label or aria-labelledby to name a link, ensure the link's visible text matches or is included in the ARIA label.

 content: "  Visual focus indicator For keyboard only users, visually tracking where they are in a page can be challenging. Mouse users can roam the page and receive two clues about actionable items: the mouse arrow turns into a hand when hovering over an actionable item, and the element displays its 'hover' state to indicate it’s actionable (e.g., an underline appears under a link). Typically, keyboard users press the Tab key to navigate the interactive elements on a web page (links, buttons, form fields, custom controls). Tabbing to an item gives it keyboard 'focus', at which point it can be activated with the keyboard. See the section Focus and focus order later in this module. Sighted keyboard users need visible feedback of a control's focus state. Web browsers provide a default visual focus indicator that varies in appearance by browser but usually consists of a border or outline around the focused element. Always avoid styles that remove or limit the visibility of keyboard focus indicators. The browser default visual focus indicator can be removed with CSS outline:0 or outline: none, which is a common barrier and anti-pattern. It's best practice to use CSS to design a highly-visible focus indicator with strong contrast. Bad example: Visual focus indicator is removed All browsers display a visible outline around the element that currently has keyboard focus, which can be disabled using the outline: 0 or outline: none CSS property. If the visual focus indicator is removed, sighted keyboard users will have no idea which link has the focus, making it difficult or impossible to navigate the web page. Example begins A link to Google Example ends CSS Code begins a:focus { outline: none; } Code ends Good example: Canada.ca visual focus indicator In this example, the first link in a menu of three has a visual focus indicator consisting of a thick black outline, set closely to the text.

 content: "  Distinguishing links from text Users with low vision and colour blindness need to distinguish links from neighboring text. The easiest way to do this is with an underline on the link. When colour is used as the only way to identify a link (meaning the underline has been removed), two conditions must be met: 3:1 contrast between the body text and the link text. A 'visual cue' (not just a color change) that appears on mouse hover and keyboard focus. The most common way to meet this is to underline the link on hover and focus, but you could also provide a background colour or border or outline. Note that this is only an issue when the link and the body text appear together. It doesn’t apply to links in the header or stacked in a menu, where they’re understood to be links by their position on the page. These requirements are in addition to the minimum text contrast requirement of 4.5:1 (see tutorial module 7 Visual design and colours > Contrast). It can be difficult to find a link colour that has both a 3:1 contrast with black body text and a 4.5:1 contrast with a white background.

Follow these best practices for skip navigation links: Place the skip navigation link at the top of the page before any other focusable element (link, button, or custom control).

 content: "  Focus and focus order What is focus? Focus refers to which interactive control on the screen -- a link, form control, button, or custom control -- currently receives input from the keyboard (and from the clipboard when you paste content). Focus determines where keyboard events go in the page. For instance, if you focus a text input field and start typing, it receives the keyboard events and displays the characters you type. While it has focus, it also receives pasted input from the clipboard. Some of the native controls even have additional keyboard support built in. For instance, with the select element focused you can press the Up and Down arrow keys to select different children, and start typing to auto-complete to one of the available items. An item with focus also has what’s called a visual focus indicator or focus ring. The style of it depends on the browser or the styling applied by the page author. Firefox, for instance, displays a dashed border, whereas Chrome highlights focused elements with a blue border. For keyboard users, focus is absolutely critical. It’s the equivalent of a mouse cursor, and it's how they reach all of the interactive controls in an application. Not all elements are focusable. Non-interactive elements like images, paragraphs, divs, and various other page elements are not focused as you tab through the page. This is by design, as users have no need to focus on something if they can't interact with it. Focus order Keyboard users navigate from interactive item to interactive item using the Tab key, in sequential order, following what’s called the focus order. They use the Shift-Tab keys to move backwards in the focus order. Like reading order, focus order is determined by the Web page’s source order. The order of interactive items (links, buttons, form controls and custom controls) in the DOM is the order in which they’re encountered by keyboard users. The keyboard navigation order must be logical and intuitive. Typically, this means ensuring the navigation follows the visual flow of the page, left to right, top to bottom. It moves through the banner, main navigation, page navigation and controls, then footer on a typical page. Focus order can be confounded by JavaScript. When JavaScript inserts new content, the content should follow the triggering element, not precede it. Screen reader users will not expect new content to fall before the trigger. Module 10’s section Focus management with JavaScript-injected content goes into greater detail. Built-in interactive HTML elements – links, buttons and form controls – are implicitly focusable, meaning they receive focus by default without additional markup. To receive focus, a link must have a populated href attribute. To prevent a link from receiving focus, remove its href attribute. To prevent a button or form control from receiving focus, add the Boolean 'disabled' attribute. When present, it makes the element not mutable, focusable, or submitted with the form. The user can neither edit nor focus on the control, nor its form control descendants. You can also prevent a control from gaining focus by giving it a tabindex='-1' attribute. Custom links and controls require a tabindex='0' attribute to receive focus. See Good example: Inserting a custom link into the tab order, below, for all the CSS, HTML attributes and JavaScript required to emulate a link. Important: When possible use a built-in HTML element instead of building a custom control with ARIA. The tabindex attribute The tabindex attribute is mostly used as a means of managing focus within widgets. A tabindex attribute value of 0 puts the element in the focus order, at its current location in the DOM. A tabindex value of -1 removes an interactive element from the focus order, but enables it to be targeted by script (and changed) using its focus() method. For instance, with the Tabs widget, only one tab at a time may be in the tab order: the selected tab has tabindex='0', while the inactive tabs have tabindex='-1'. The tabindex values change as the keyboard user navigates across the tabs, using the Arrow keys to set focus on a new tab. See the description of the Tabs widget in module 12. A tabindex value greater than 0 is almost always a bad idea and should be avoided. It moves the element to the beginning of the page’s focus order, and is encountered in ascending order with any other positive tabindex values. Positive tabindex values are difficult to maintain and brittle, and their use tends to confound user expectations of focus order. Instead, write the document with the elements in a logical sequence. See Bad example: Page design with positive tab index values, below. Good example: Inserting a custom link into the tab order using tabindex='0' In the example below, press the Tab to move focus forward from link to link, and the Shift-Tab keys to move focus backwards. The third link is a custom link: The tabindex='0' attribute adds the element to the focus order. The role='link' attribute identifies it to screen reader users. The class='link' attribute enables styling to match default links and to provide a highly-visible keyboard focus indicator. The click event handles mouse and touch input. The keydown event handles Enter key input. Example begins Bing DuckDuckGo Google Example ends View HTML Code begins Bing DuckDuckGo <span tabindex='0' role='link' class='link' onclick='goToLink(event, 'http://www.google.ca/')' onkeydown='goToLink(event, 'http://www.google.ca/')'> Google View CSS Code begins .link:focus, .link:hover { outline: 3px solid orange; } span.link { cursor: pointer; color: #0000EE; text-decoration: underline; } span.link:active { color: #FF0000; } Code ends View Javascript Code begins function goToLink (event, url) { var type = event.type; if ((type === 'click') || (type === 'keydown' && event.keyCode === 13)) { window.location.href = url; event.preventDefault(); event.stopPropagation(); } } Code ends The custom link JavaScript is from the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) document: Link Examples in the Link pattern of the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1. Matt King, JaEun Jemma Ku, James Nurthen, Zoë Bijl, Michael Cooper. Copyright © 2019 W3C® (MIT, ERCIM, Keio). Element with tabindex = '-1' A tabindex='-1' attribute value removes the element from the focus order, but allows it to receive programmatic focus. This means focus can be set to it using the element’s JavaScript focus() method. Good example: Element with tabindex='-1' receives focus by script In this example, clicking the button sets focus on the div element. Example begins Click on me to focus the DIV I am a div Example ends HTML Code begins Click on me to focus the DIV I am a div Code ends Element with tabindex > '0' Using a tabindex attribute value greater than 0 is considered an anti-pattern. Any tabindex greater than 0 jumps the element to the front of the natural tab order. If there are multiple elements with a tabindex > 0, then the tab order starts from the lowest value greater than zero and works its way up. Positive tabindex values often create counter-intuitive flow for keyboard users. If you want an element to come sooner in the tab order, move it to an earlier spot in the DOM rather than set a positive tabindex value. Bad example: Page design with positive tab index values The tab order when user tabs the page is as follows: The 'Going to' field (tabindex='1') The 'Check-in' field (tabindex='2') The 'Check-out' field (tabindex='3') A mystery object that has no functionality, and no visible focus indicator (tabindex='4') 'More travel' and then follows the natural tab order (tabindex='0'). Example begins Example ends The positive tabindex is set on just four items in the 'Carnival' page. After navigating through the positive tabindex values, keyboard users are sent back to the top, to the first focusable control on the page at the beginning of the natural tab order. A visually hidden item is in the tab order on the page, creating a 'mystery' focus that can lead to confusion. If something is visually hidden, it must not be in the tab order. Avoid using tabindex values greater than 0. Instead, write the document with the elements in a logical sequence. Ensure the source code (DOM) order matches the visual order to avoid confusion for assistive technology users.

Just by talking, voice input users will unintentionally trigger a shortcut consisting only of letter keys, since their speech input is converted by the software into a string of letters. Users who are prone to accidentally hitting keys will also trigger the shortcut. WCAG Success Criterion 2.1.4: If a keyboard shortcut is implemented in content using only letter (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then at least one of the following is true: Turn off A mechanism is available to turn the shortcut off; Remap A mechanism is available to remap the shortcut to include one or more non-printable keyboard keys (e.g., Ctrl, Alt); Active only on focus The keyboard shortcut for a user interface component is only active when that component has focus.

 content: "  Designing with CAPTCHA Web sites use CAPTCHA to protect their mail systems from spam robots, presenting the user with a simple challenge that a robot would find difficult. The word is an initialism for 'Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart'. Example begins This CAPTCHA of 'smwm' obscures its message from computer interpretation by adding a slight background colour gradient and twisting the letters. Example ends The primary barrier with any traditional CAPTCHA is that it serves a test to a single sense (sight or sound), which excludes people with related disabilities. To make CAPTCHA as accessible as possible, WCAG 2.1 requires two Techniques and recommends some optional steps to reach the edge cases: Provide two different modalities of CAPTCHA. For example, provide a visual task, such as typing words displayed in a image, and an audio task, such as typing letters spoken in an audio file Provide alt text saying the CAPTCHA requires completing a task and what type of task it is; for instance, 'Type the word in the image' or 'Type the letters spoken in the audio'. When an alternate version of a CAPTCHA is available, include instructions in the alt text on how to find it. Optional steps: Provide more than two modalities of CAPTCHAs. For instance, a third test might be a logic puzzle. Provide access to a human customer service representative who can bypass CAPTCHA. Don't require CAPTCHAs for authorized users. Recent CAPTCHA technology determines a human user by analyzing, among other things, the user's cookies, plugins, and javascript objects: The W3C Draft Note Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA reports that Google's reCAPTCHA v2 overwhelmingly dominates CAPTCHA deployment on the web and is accessible to most users. It consists of a simple checkbox proclaiming 'I'm not a robot', while under the hood the software is rigorously analyzing user data. However, the W3C Draft Note reports that keyboard navigation has been widely observed to fail, and audio CAPTCHAs are sometimes no longer being provided. Interestingly, optional step 3 of not requiring CAPTCHAs appears to be feasible. The same W3C report offers 'praise and gratitude' for Google's non-interactive reCAPTCHA v3, when it works. It removes v2's checkbox. The W3C authors have two caveats, both related to when v3 produces an ambiguous reliability score: If the score is ambiguous Google encourages users to use reCAPTCHA v2 as backup, which has some reported barriers. Methods for disambiguating an ambiguous non-interactive score must be well documented and easily implementable, or developers will use the older backup. ",

Image Description Guidelines - DIAGRAM Center Good example: Long description containing structured information In this example, the alt text reads “Bar chart showing physical activity by three age groups pre-COVID and during COVID. Long description follows”. The long description provides detailed information, including scales, values, relationships and trends that are represented visually. For example, the long description can point out the declining values for youth, consistent values for adults (18 to 64), and increasing values for older adults. This example includes the long description in a / toggle widget below the chart.

 content: "  Approaches to providing short and long descriptions Approach 1: A text link to the long description next to the image This approach and markup work universally across user agents: Add a link directly after the image. The link can target a different page or the same page. The link text describes its purpose and topic (e.g., “Text description of Topic X”). Set the image in a element and the link in a element. The element’s alt attribute contains the short description or title. In this approach, the alt text doesn’t need to indicate the location of the long description (the link does that). HTML Code begins Text description of the physical activity bar chart. Code ends Approach 2: A details/summary block for the long description next to the image As per Approach 1, but instead of a link the summary element next to the image expands to show the details. The image alt text mentions that “The text description follows.” The summary element must describe its purpose and topic (e.g., “Text description of Topic X”). Ensure any headings used in the text description fit correctly into the existing page’s heading hierarchy. HTML Code begins Text description of the physical activity bar chart. Chart 1: Percentage of Canadian youth and adults who reported meeting physical activity recommendations in the past week, prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic Overview […] Code ends Approach 3: Structurally associating the image and its adjacent long description The element encloses both the image and its long description. The headings, text, and table comprising the long description are wrapped in the element. HTML Code begins Overview The bar chart shows physical activity by three age groups pre-COVID and during COVID Values Physical activity by three age groups pre-COVID and during COVID […] Code ends Approach 4: Providing a link to the long description via longdesc The element’s longdesc attribute takes a URI as value, like a link’s href attribute. The link targets a long description either on a separate web page or the same page. Implementation of the link is up to the user agent. For instance, Firefox provides a “View Description” link via the image’s context menu, while Chrome offers the same functionality through an extension. Since the attribute is not well-supported (Safari has no support and neither do mobile platforms), we do not recommend you use longdesc. If you do, only use longdesc along with a redundant, visible link positioned below the image, as per Approach 1. HTML Code begins Text Description Code ends ",

 content: "  Approach 1: Providing an accessible name using the img element's alt attribute With this approach, a functional image's alt attribute value provides the link text or the control name, declared by screen readers. The text alternative for the image should convey the action or result rather than the literal description of the image. Missing or empty alt values in functional images create significant problems for screen reader users. Buttons and custom controls declare only their role (e.g., “button”, “tab”) and state (e.g., “expanded”). Linked images declare their role (“link”), and in the absence of an alt attribute value, screen readers take a guess and instead declare the image file name or link URL, neither of which may be descriptive. Good example: Linked image In the example below, the Canada.ca logo in the banner links to the Canada.ca homepage. The element is nested in the link. The alt text “Government of Canada home page” provides the link text. Example begins Example ends HTML Code begins Code ends Good example: Icon with meaningful alt text nested in link text In this example, an icon with the meaningful alt text “Opens in new window” is nested inside the link along with the link text “W3C Homepage”. Screen reader users experience the link as “W3C homepage, opens in new window.” Example begins W3C Homepage Example ends HTML Code begins W3C Homepage Code ends Note: This technique is often used with icons to indicate different file formats such as AVI, ODF, MP3, PDF, Word, etc. In that case, the text alternative should convey the format represented by each icon. Good example: Functional icon In this example, a clickable icon representing a printer denotes print functionality. Its text alternative is “Print this page”, rather than the literal “Printer”, because the purpose is to activate the print dialog. Example begins Example ends HTML Code begins Code ends Good example: Image used in a button The following image is used to give the button a distinct style. In this case, it is the button to initiate a search request and the nested icon is a magnifying lens. The text alternative for the image is “search” to convey the purpose of the button, rather than the literal “magnifying lens”. Example begins Search Example ends HTML Code begins Code ends Good example: Redundant image within link text In this example, the Company XYZ logo accompanies a text link that leads to the Company XYZ home page. The image does not represent different functionality or convey other information than that already provided in the link text. In effect the image is a simple visual assist to the link text.

The alt attribute of the nested element is set to null (empty): alt=''. The child element's alt attribute could hold any value and it wouldn’t matter. It’s overridden by the aria-label or aria-labelledby attribute, which take precedence over child text when naming an element.

The alt attribute is set to null (empty): alt=''. HTML Code begins Code ends Good example: Naming functional images using the aria-label and aria-labelledby attributes In this example, two text-styling buttons are each accompanied by an identical “more” details button. The styling buttons are named with the aria-label attribute. The “more” buttons are named with the aria-labelledby attribute, pointing to the id attribute values of the elements holding the desired label fragments: “More” + either “Bullets” or “Text alignment”.

Example begins Example ends HTML Code begins Code ends Alternative approach: One instance of the “more” text label When using the aria-labelledby attribute, developers may prefer targeting a single id attribute value for the name of a repeating element With this approach, one defining instance of the text “More” is given an id attribute value and set to CSS display: none. The aria-labelledby (and aria-describedby) attribute can target an element that’s set to display: none. The aria-labelledby attribute concatenates a name by pointing to the id attribute values of that defining instance and the partner button, resulting in labels ”More Bullets” and “More Text alignment”. Unlike in the first approach, the “more” buttons do not need id or aria-label attributes, as they’re not contributing to the concatenated label. HTML Code begins More Code ends ",

 content: "  Avoiding images of text Images of text are more likely to distort and pixelate when resized and can be problematic for mobile users and users of low vision. In situations where images of text must be used, the text alternative must contain the same text presented in the image. It is good design practice to use real text, formatted and styled with CSS to fit the design rather than an image of text. Actual text can be modified, resized without losing clarity to suit the reading preferences of users and is more flexible than images. Unless the image of text is essential or customizable, images should not include informative text. Text that is part of a logo or brand name is considered essential. Good example: Text styled with CSS In this example, real text styled with CSS is used rather than an image of text. The CSS properties are solely responsible for font and text styling, spacing and layout.

 content: "  Mathematical expressions Designing with mathematical expressions HTML lacks markup for mathematical expressions as structures, and there is no simple way to produce anything essentially two-dimen­sion­al beyond superscripting or subscripting. There are two approaches: Use an image with alt text or long description describing the math expression. Tag the math expression semantically in MathML and use a JavaScript math library. Approach 1: Use an image with alt text describing the math expression Images of math expressions should only be used when math is an exception to the regular content of the website. In these cases, the element’s alt attribute value should communicate the math expression, unless more than 150 characters is required, in which case a long description should be used. In the example below, the image displays a recurring decimal number and the alt text is “zero point one, recurring” Example begins Example ends HTML Code begins Code ends Approach 2: Use MathML The preferred method for capturing math expressions as semantic, accessible content is with the markup language MathML. MathML markup allows user agents to determine the structure of math expressions in a machine-readable way. Most web browsers need plugins to render MathML correctly for presentation, such as the open-source MathJax library, which provides support for display and additional accessibility features. JavaScript math libraries commonly support math expressions written in Tex and LaTeX and AsciiMath, not just MathML. In the example below, MathML communicates a math expression with semantic markup and proper syntax to assistive technologies like screen readers. MathJax renders it for the screen with the correct typesetting.

A custom control will often set the name via the aria-label or aria-labelledby attribute. Role The role defines what the widget is or does. The ARIA specification defines a list of roles to choose from, such as 'checkbox' or 'radiogroup' or 'slider' or 'tab'. Value The value, sometimes several values, defines dynamic “states” and static “properties” of the control: States “States” are ARIA attributes with values the script updates in reaction to the user.

Associate any descriptive text in the form with the relevant form element using the aria-labelledby or aria-describedby attribute.

This approach guarantees the additional description is communicated to assistive tech, but should only be used with short descriptions. Example begins Example begins Example ends Health card number 1234-567-890-XX Example ends HTML Code begins Health card number 1234-567-890-XX Code ends Good example: Providing form control instructions with aria-describedby The more common approach to providing instructions outside of labels is to use the aria-describedby attribute. The attribute is set on the control and points to the id attribute value of the element containing the description. Example begins Password Must contain at least 8 characters, one uppercase letter and one special character Example ends HTML Code begins Password Must contain at least 8 characters, one uppercase letter and one special character Code ends Placeholder text Text in the placeholder attribute provides instructions or an example of the required data format inside form fields that have not yet been edited by the user. Note that placeholder text disappears from a form field when users start entering text. If the placeholder text contains instructional information or examples that disappear, it makes it more difficult for users to check their responses before submitting the form. Placeholder text is not a replacement for labels. Assistive technologies such as screen readers do not treat placeholder text as labels. Example begins Search Email Example ends HTML Code begins Search Email Code ends Styling the placeholder In many browsers, the default placeholder attribute colour fails a contrast check, making it difficult for many people to see. The colour of the placeholder can be styled using CSS. The example below sets the foreground color to a medium gray (hex #767676) against a white background, which just meets the minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio requirement. Example begins Search courses First name Last name Email Example ends View HTML Code begins Search courses First name Last name Email Code ends View CSS Code begins ::-webkit-input-placeholder { color: #767676 !important; opacity: 1; } :-moz-placeholder { /* Firefox 18- */ color: #767676 !important; opacity: 1; } ::-moz-placeholder { /* Firefox 19+ */ color: #767676 !important; opacity: 1; } :-ms-input-placeholder { color: #767676 !important; opacity: 1; } Code ends ",

Text in a non-focusable element is missed unless it is programmatically associated with a form control as label or description. Good example: Group instructions in a legend In this example, the word “Required” is set within the to indicate that everything within the related fieldset is required.

 content: "  Overview – Identifying input purpose When a form input field collects personal information such as the user’s name, phone number, email and street addresses, programmatically define its semantics with the autocomplete attribute. Assistive technologies leverage the autocomplete attribute value to automatically complete forms, drawing on past user input stored in the browser. This saves the user from having to type the information. Assistive technologies also leverage the autocomplete value to pair input fields with icons, for users who prefer using images for communication. The attribute value takes one of 53 potential field names from WCAG’s list of Input Purposes for User Interface Components. The field names are either broad or narrow. For instance, regarding the user’s name, it’s possible to identify an input’s purpose as full name, given name, family name, or nickname. You can further refine the purpose by adding space-separated autofill detail tokens to the autocomplete value: shipping billing home work mobile fax pager Use autocomplete on elements that take a text or numeric value as input, elements and elements.

This approach should only be used when the label of the control is clear from the surrounding content. In this example, each service is accompanied by an “Add to cart” button. An aria-labelledby attribute distinguishes the buttons from one another by concatenating a name out of the button itself and the preceding heading (e.g., “Add to cart Service 1”).

Multi-step forms can be less daunting and easier to understand and correct than a long form. Multi-step forms can be designed across pages, or on the same page. Follow these best practices for multi-step forms: Split the form up according to its logical groups of controls (e.g., contact information and questionnaire). Validate the current step before exposing the next. Label optional steps and enable users to skip them. Ensure keyboard focus moves smoothly from step to step, backwards and forwards. At a new step, set the focus preferably on the next relevant form element, or relevant heading or container (a heading or container would need the tabindex='-1' attribute to programmatically receive focus). Avoid a time limit to fill out the form. If a limit is required, enable the user to adjust or extend the time limit. If the steps are across pages, repeat overall instructions on every page.

Approach 1: Using the page title Add a note indicating progress (e.g., “Step 2 of 4:”) to the beginning of the element, before the name of the step or any error notification. The element is the first thing declared on page load to screen reader users and so provides immediate feedback. HTML Code begins Step 2 of 4: Contact information – Survey X – Company Z Code ends Approach 2: Using the main heading Add a note indicating progress (e.g., “(Step 2 of 4)” to the end of the page’s main heading, making the information prominent and easily discoverable by visual scan. HTML Code begins Contact information (Step 2 of 4) Code ends Approach 3: Using the HTML5 progress element You can use a HTML5 element to inform users of their progress, as the first element in each step. Example begins Survey (Step 1 of 7) Example ends HTML Code begins Survey (Step 1 of 7) Code ends Some operating systems animate the element, which violates WCAG’s Success Criterion 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide.

This example uses an ordered list with each step being a list item. Visually hidden text, off screen but still encountered by assistive tech, indicates the current and completed status of steps (the WET class .wb-inv visually hides the text).

Some scripting may be necessary for validation when using custom controls or supporting legacy browsers. In these situations, the user notifications should be accessible, as described in the section User notifications. To ensure security, data needs to be validated both on the client-side and on the server-side as well. Most user data can be validated using validation attributes on HTML5 form controls. The following are common validation attributes: required attribute Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted. See Validating required input. type attribute Specifies the type of data. See Validating common input types. pattern attribute Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow. See Validating pattern input. minlength and maxlength attributes Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data. See Validating length of entries. min and max attributes Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types. See Validating length of entries.

To identify required fields semantically, add the required attribute to the control. The required attribute triggers client-side validation in the browser. Current web browsers support the attribute and notify the user of missing required input using a standard web browser dialog. These dialogs respect user settings and preferences in the browser and operating system, such as default font-size, colors, and language. The presence of the required attribute enables use of the :required pseudoclass for CSS styling. If the required has no value, it enables use of the :invalid pseudoclass. See the following Good example. Good example: Browser validation of required input In this example, the browser will not allow the form to be submitted until text is entered in the required input field.

Modern web browsers provide built-in client-side error validation for these new input types. For instance, a malformed URL triggers the browser to display a dialog with the message “Please enter a URL.” To help users input data more easily, HTML5 provides controls for some of the new input types, such as a date picker and spin buttons for incrementing or decrementing numbers. For instance, in the example below, modern browsers display the “Number” input field with buttons to increase or decrease the number and display the “Range” input field as a slider control. Legacy web browsers that don’t support the new input types display a simple text field. Input types already in use when HTML5 was introduced text Defines a one-line text input field password Defines a one-line password input field submit Defines a submit button to submit the form to server reset Defines a reset button to reset all values in the form. radio Defines a radio button which allows select one option. checkbox Defines checkboxes which allow select multiple options forms. button Defines a simple push button, which can be programmed to perform a task on an event. file Defines a file retrieval field. image Defines a graphical submit button.

 content: "  Distinguishing links and controls from text Users with low vision and colour blindness need to distinguish links and controls from neighbouring text. The easiest way to do this is with an underline on the link and a border on a control. When colour is used as the only way to identify a link (meaning the underline has been removed) or a control, two conditions must be met: 3:1 contrast between the body text and the link text or control. A 'visual cue' (not just a colour change) that appears on mouse hover and keyboard focus. The most common way to meet this is to underline the link on hover and focus, but you could also provide a background colour or border or outline. Note that this is only an issue when the link or control and the body text appear together. It doesn’t apply to links or controls in the header or stacked in a menu, where they’re understood to be links or controls by their position on the page. These requirements are in addition to the minimum contrast requirement of 4.5:1 between foreground text and background. It can be difficult to find a link or control colour that has both a 3:1 contrast with black body text and a 4.5:1 contrast with a white background. WCAG Technique G183 lists colour values that do, in Example 1. Good example: Underline hyperlink text In this example, the hyperlink text is differentiated from the surrounding normal text by underlining. Example begins The IT Accessibility Office (ITAO) remains to be a provider of adaptive technology and an advocate for inclusiveness of people with disabilities in the workplace. Example ends Good example: High contrast with a visual effect on hover and focus This example avoids a static underline by: Using blue (#3333FF) as the link colour, which has a 3.1:1 contrast with neighbouring black text (just exceeds the minimum 3:1) a 6.9:1 contrast with the background white (well exceeds the minimum 4.5:1) As an additional visual cue on hover or focus, the link text is set in a very high contrast (21:1) of white against black background. Example begins The IT Accessibility Office (ITAO) remains to be a provider of adaptive technology and an advocate for inclusiveness of people with disabilities in the workplace. Example ends Results from the Colour Contrast Analyser Figure 6: The Colour Contrast Analyser finds a 3.1:1 contrast ratio between the links’ blue (hex #333FF) and the neighbouring text’s black (hex #000000). Figure 7: The Colour Contrast Analyser finds a 6.9:1 contrast ratio between the links’ blue (hex #3333FF) and the background white (hex #FFFFFF). After receiving keyboard focus or mouse hover Figure 8: The Colour Contrast Analyser finds a 21:1 contrast ratio between the links’ white (hex #FFFFFF) and the background’s black (hex #000000). Bad example: Colour alone distinguishes links from text In this bad example, the blue foreground colour indicates that the last two icons are links. The blue has the required 3:1 contrast with the black of the neighbouring text, but it has no additional visual effect on hover or focus. Example begins A bright new idea The latest model of Tesla Navigation Contact us Example ends Good example: Border supplements colour to distinguish links from basic text In this good example, the borders on hover and focus indicate that the last two icons are links. Example begins A bright new idea The latest model of Tesla Navigation Contact us Example ends Customization of interface colour and contrast Some users with sensitivity to brightness or with low vision will expect to be able to modify colours. Whenever possible, use native controls and features of HTML. That allows users to customize interface colour and contrast for the visible UI components.

 content: "  Designing with sufficient contrast If text, including images of text, lacks sufficient contrast with its background it won’t be legible to users with low vision or colour blindness. Controls and meaningful graphics also require good contrast. To meet the WCAG Level AA Success Criterion for minimum contrast, follow these best practices: Ensure small text (under 18 point [24 pixels] regular font or under 14 point [19 pixels] bold font) has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 with the background. Ensure large text (at least 18 point [24 pixels] regular font or 14 point [19 pixels] bold font) has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with the background. Ensure non-text content – active user interface components (i.e., controls) and their states, and meaningful graphics – has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with adjacent colours. Meeting WCAG Level AAA criteria is often difficult, but that's not the case with enhanced contrast. We should strive for it whenever possible. To meet the WCAG Level AAA Success Criterion for enhanced contrast, increase the contrast ratio of small and large text as follows: Ensure small text (under 18 point [24 pixels] regular font or under 14 point [19 pixels] bold font) has a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 with the background. Ensure large text (at least18 point [24 pixels] regular font or 14 point [19 pixels] bold font) has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 with the background. For user interface components, the 3:1 contrast ratio with adjacent colours: Applies to the control and the control’s state information, such as whether a component is selected or focused. Applies to the visual boundary indicating the hit area, unless the control contains text that meets the 4.5:1 contrast ratio. Doesn’t apply if the appearance of the control and its states are controlled by the user agent and not modified by the author. Doesn’t apply if the control is disabled. Check contrast manually using the Colour Contrast Analyzer (CCA). Automated tools check background contrast, but manual inspection is necessary when the background is a gradient, an image, an animation or video. If the background changes over time, or as the user scrolls or as the viewport changes, the contrast should persist, though brief (1 second) intervals of poor contrast won’t interfere with the user experience. The 3:1 contrast ratio for adjacent colours also applies to meaningful graphics, which includes informative icons, lines in line graphs, and slices in pie charts: Check the contrast of the graphical object against its adjacent colours. If there are multiple colours and/or a gradient, choose the least contrasting area to test. If the least-contrasting area is less than 3:1, assume that area is invisible.

 content: "  Designing with CSS-generated content CSS can generate text and icons through the ::before and ::after pseudo-classes. However, WCAG 2.1 fails any use of non-decorative CSS-generated content, since it can be overwritten by user style sheets (used by users with low vision), it lacks a role, and it's invisible to browser find functionality, among other reasons mentioned in this defense of WCAG Failure F87. That said, there is a use case for supplemental, CSS-generated text and a mostly-accessible technique for informative icons. Follow these best practices with CSS-generated content: Hide decorative CSS-generated content from screen readers with the aria-hidden='true' attribute. Don't use CSS-generated text. Exception: Use CSS-generated text to expose mark, del, ins, and s elements to screen reader users. For informative CSS-generated icons: Set the icon on a element, and: Hide it from screen reader users with the aria-hidden attribute. Add a visible label for mouse users with the title attribute. Add a label for screen-reader users in a second element, visually-hidden with the WET CSS class .wb-inv. This approach differs from the WET Style Guide's Icons pattern by adding the title and aria-hidden attributes. It doesn't address the needs of low vision keyboard users. WCAG 2.1 also offers an informative CSS icon technique, ARIA24: Semantically identifying a font icon with role='img', but it requires a specific style declaration in the user's stylesheet, intended to protect the icon font family declaration from being overwritten. Though not mentioned in WCAG 2.1, using ARIA24 entails promoting its existence to your users with low vision. Also, the defense of WCAG Failure F87 suggests that ARIA24's solution lacks necessary semantics. There is no ideal technique for CSS-generated icon fonts. ",

 content: "  Hiding content Content can be hidden from three groups of users: From all users, by using either the CSS display:none or visibility:hidden declaration. From users of assistive technology, by using the aria-hidden='true' attribute to remove the element from the Accessibility API. From sighted users, by using the WET CSS class .wb-inv to visually hide the content. When hiding inactive content, such as untriggered modal windows and unselected sub-menus, hide it from all users. Developers frequently introduce a barrier by visually hiding such content offscreen via CSS positioning, leaving the content exposed to the accessibility API, where it’s encountered by screen reader users and others. If it needs to be hidden from sighted users, it needs to be hidden from screen reader users. Use the aria-hidden attribute with caution, and only to improve the experience for users of assistive technology by removing redundant or extraneous information. If you use aria-hidden to hide meaningful visible content you must ensure that identical or equivalent meaning and functionality is exposed to assistive technologies. Visually-hidden text can: provide a name where ARIA labels won’t work because the element doesn’t receive focus. This is illustrated in the example of CSS-generated content in the previous section. The same approach would work with a CSS background image needing a name; for instance, a list holding logos set as CSS background images could use a visually-hidden name in each list item. name or extend the name of elements as an alternative to ARIA labels. For example, on a page with multiple “read more” links, to distinguish each link’s purpose from the other, the preceding heading text is inserted as a visually-hidden element into the link text.

Your design should be flexible enough to render without any loss of content or functionality when the user modifies the text spacing, within these constraints: Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size; Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size; Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size; Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.

HTML Code begins […] Code ends The width=device-width parameter instructs the page to match the device’s screen width. This allows the page to reflow content to match different screen sizes.

Good example: Pinch-to-zoom set to 200% magnification In this example, the page is configured to allow a maximum 200% zoom via the maximum-scale property. 200% is the minimum zoom value required by WCAG.

 content: "  Reflow content Some users with low vision need to greatly enlarge text and read it in a single column. When these users zoom the browser to scale content to 400%, WCAG requires that content reflows into one column so that scrolling in more than one direction is not necessary. The relevant success criterion reads as follows: Success Criterion 1.4.10 Reflow (Level AA): Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for: Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels. Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning. 320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport width of 1280 CSS pixels wide at 400% zoom. For web content which is designed to scroll horizontally (e.g., with vertical text), 256 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport height of 1024 CSS pixels at 400% zoom. You can test this success criterion by adjusting your browser window: to 320 pixels wide by 256 pixels high, or to 1280 pixels wide by 1024 pixels high then zooming the content to 400%. Content should appear in a single column with no horizontal scrolling and no loss of information or functionality. You can also use the Firefox (Control + Shift + M) or Chrome (Control + Shift + I) built-in mobile emulator to display different viewport sizes. You meet this success criterion by implementing a responsive design, as described in the next section. With responsive design, you increasingly simplify the UI for ever smaller screen sizes, primarily using HTML and CSS but with some JavaScript for widgets that show/hide content. For instance, a hamburger button on mobile toggling a menu that’s on full display on the desktop provides equivalent info and functionality. Avoiding horizontal scrolling to reveal parts of lines cut off by the viewport is important, because such scrolling significantly increases the effort required to read. It is also important that content is not hidden off-screen. Bear these best practices in mind when designing content to reflow in a single column: The main content fills the viewport. Horizontal scrolling doesn’t happen. Avoid using multiple columns. The short line length is hard to read. Avoid using CSS floats. They also create short line length, unless the floated element is very small. Avoid using CSS fixed widths and minimum widths. They tend to cause horizontal scrolling. Sometimes it’s not possible to prevent horizontal scrolling. The success criterion exempts large data tables that can’t be simplified, and toolbars with a lot of buttons. Note that not all low vision users benefit from magnification. A user with tunnel vision may be able to read paragraph text just fine while benefiting from other design considerations, such as placing form controls close to their labels. Good example: Reflow content In this example, when the page is narrowed to 320 pixels the horizontal navigation bar collapses to a vertical stack in a single column. See this example in action (Opens in new tab). Narrow the browser window to trigger the single column layout.

As per WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.4: Resize text, when the design’s text size increases by 200%, ensure there is no overlap or clipping of content, no loss of information or functionality. This criterion used to require testing your design with the text size (alone) increased to 200%. However, the related WCAG Failure F69 (linked below) was revised to allow testing with basic zoom: The Working Group has discovered many misunderstandings about how to test this failure. We are planning to revise this failure in a future update. Until then, if the content passes the success criterion using any of the listed sufficient techniques, then it does not meet this failure. One of the Techniques sufficient to meeting 1.4.4: Resize text is simply using HTML5, for which all modern browsers support zoom (WCAG Technique G142, linked below).

 content: "  Animation from interactions People with vestibular (inner ear) disorders need control over movement triggered by interactions. Movement can trigger vestibular disorder reactions, including distraction, dizziness, headaches and nausea. WCAG requires (at Level AAA) that motion animation triggered by interaction can be disabled unless the animation is essential to the functionality or the information being conveyed. Moving new content into the viewport is essential for scrolling. The user controls the essential scrolling movement, so it is allowed. If scrolling a page causes elements to move (other than the essential movement associated with scrolling), it's problematic. Parallax scrolling is also problematic. It occurs when scrolling backgrounds move at a different rate to foregrounds. WCAG recommends choosing one of three alternatives for reducing the chances of triggering a vestibular disorder: Avoid using unnecessary animation. Provide a control for users to turn off non-essential animations from user interaction (site wide) Take advantage of the reduced motion feature in the user-agent or operating system with the CSS prefers-reduced-motion media query: CSS Code begins @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { /* CSS to disable motion goes here */ } Code ends Good example: Combining operating system reduced motion feature with CSS media query CSS offers a prefers-reduced-motion media query that respects user settings for motion. This example demonstrates a :hover and :focus jiggling motion on a button. It's disabled when both: the prefers-reduced-motion CSS Media Query is set to reduce, and the user-agent or operating system has the reduced motion feature set. Example: Motion triggered by user interaction CSS Code begins button:focus, button:hover { animation: shake 0.82s cubic-bezier(.36,.07,.19,.97) both; } @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { button:focus, button:hover { animation: none; } } Code ends Note that Windows 10 has the option to turn off 'Show animations in Windows': Example begins The Show animations in Windows option is turned off in the Windows 10 Ease of Access settings, under Display > Simplify and personalise Windows. Example ends You can instead emulate the operating system's reduced motion feature in a browser that offers the option. For instance, in Chrome's Tools menu, the Rendering submenu offers 'Emulate CSS media feature prefers-reduced-motion'. Activating that option is equivalent to changing the operating system's setting.

 content: "  Parallax Parallax scrolling occurs when backgrounds move at a different rate to foregrounds. It involves extra non-essential animations when the user scrolls. Decorative elements move horizontally when the essential page content is scrolled vertically. For some people, this can trigger vestibular disorders including dizziness, nausea and headaches. Avoid parallax scrolling or provide a control for user to turn it off. Keyboard users must be able to access the hidden area of a parallax scrolling area and use all of the features of the web page. If in CSS the hidden content is set to display: none, keyboard users may not be able to access the hidden parts of the content.

 content: "  Transcribing audio to text Transcription best practice is nearly identical for captions and transcripts. When transcribing, the goal is accuracy: Never paraphrase or omit words (and do not censor). Never substitute words. Never rearrange the order of speech. Never correct or edit a speaker’s grammar. Never provide clarifying information in the captions (you may in the transcript). Transcribe all speech and non-speech sounds (laughs, groans, sighs, screams, car backfiring, footsteps approaching, distant roaring) Identify the speakers. Use the full name the first time and single name otherwise. If a speaker is not identified, use Speaker + number (e.g, Speaker 1, Speaker 2) or use a role/title without a number (e.g., interviewer, Doctor) Exclude non-relevant speech and non-relevant background noise. Do not reveal intentionally held information before the appropriate time. Include relevant information about the speech, e.g., (whispering), (mouthing). Put non-speech sounds in parenthesis, italics, lowercase, and with a space before and after, e.g., ( chatter in distance ) Use punctuation to convey emphasis. For interrupted speech, use a dash at the end of the line. Use all capital letters only to indicate yelling. When the speech is unintelligible or inaudible, transcribe [inaudible] Indicate large silences as (silence). Include background music if it's important to understand the content: Identify music with the uppercase label MUSIC (or a verb implying music), followed by a colon and the title in quotation marks followed by the artist. Transcribe important lyrics with musical notes to either side, e.g., ♪ A long, long time ago ♪ Describe music that’s not part of the action but sets the mood, e.g., ♪ scary music ♪ Best practices unique to transcripts: For descriptive transcripts, include all relevant audio information as well as description of all relevant visual information. If your transcript is generated from timed text files ensure descriptions fit into gaps in the main audio, or use a player that can pause the video during the description. Transcripts include onscreen text in videos. Captions do not include onscreen text. Ensure transcripts identify the source of sounds, rather than just describing them. In some cases, such as legal depositions, the transcript must be verbatim, including ums, ahs, and indicating pauses. Headings, topics and links can make the transcript more usable. Include timestamps only when useful. Add a timestamp to inaudible audio. ",

They are synchronized with the audio and usually shown in a media player when users turn them on. Captions benefit users who are deaf, users who are hard of hearing and users who have difficulty processing auditory information. Captions are also used by people without disabilities in a variety of situations: In loud environments where users cannot hear the audio. In quiet environments where users cannot turn on sounds. By users who understand the written language better than the spoken language. By users learning to read a new language. To better understand content with redundant audio and text, helping users focus and retain information. To help locate the document via search. Closed captions are indexed by search engines, making the page more findable. Captions are usually shown in a media player when users turn them on, called “closed captions”.

 content: "  Live captions Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) is the live, word-for-word transcription of speech to text so that individuals can read what is being said in group settings. A professional CART writer transcribes the spoken word into written English or French text using a stenotype machine, laptop and real-time software. The text is then displayed on a secure website, laptop computer or projected onto a large screen. CART services are typically provided on-site at live training, meetings, events, conventions and conferences. However, CART services can also be provided remotely for events like web casts. When CART is provided remotely, the CART writer attends the meeting from an off-site location to listen and transcribe. The text is streamed to a secure website for viewing. Multiple users can simultaneously login to the secure website to display the text on their computers, tablets or mobile devices. The live captioned text can be saved and edited for use as a captions file for any posted video recordings. Live automated captions are also available in Microsoft Teams meetings.

Captions use no more than three lines at a time. Put a new sentence on a new line. Maximum number of characters per line is 32 characters. Insert caption line breaks at logical points rather than in the middle of a phrase. Default colors are white text on a black background. Default color contrast ratio between font color and background color is a minimum of 3:1 (font size at least 18 points). Default font size is at least 22pt. Position captions to not obscure on-screen text, people’s faces and other important visual information. Ensure a minimum of 1.5 seconds gap in between captions. Remove captions from long silent intervals. Captions have a maximum duration of 6 seconds. ",

 content: "  The four methods of providing audio description In order of preference, these are the four methods of providing audio description: Integrated New videos are scripted so that the speaker describes the visual information. No separate description is needed. When writing the script, ensure all relevant visual information is included. For instance, a speaker presenting a chart provides the key information, such as: “The chart compares physical activity pre-COVID and post-COVID for three age groups. Youth, aged 12 to 17, reported less physical activity; adults, aged 18 to 64, reported the same amount; older adults, aged 65+, reported more physical activity.” Timed text file If the video player supports description from a text file, provide a timed text file. The description must fit in the space of the main audio, or the player must provide functionality to pause during the description. Write out the descriptions and add timestamps in the file format used by the player (see the example VTT format, below). Separate audio file If the video player supports a separate audio track for description, and if there’s enough space in the main audio for it, provide description in a separate audio file. Ensure the descriptions play in the audio spaces within the main video. Provide a captions file of the description. Separate described video Otherwise, provide a separate described video. Write and record the descriptions, then create a new audio file by combining the original audio with the new description audio. If the descriptions fit in the spaces and if your media player uses separate video and audio tracks, you’re finished. If your player uses a single video that includes the audio, generate a new video with the audio you just created. If the descriptions don’t fit in the spaces: If you can extend the scenes with extra footage from the original shoot, recut the video to fill in the visual space where you need time for description. If you can’t extend the scenes, leave a static image in the video while the description is playing in the audio, aka Extended video description. Good example: Audio description with separate described video (extended scene) The W3C-WAI user perspectives videos offer audio description alternative videos with extra footage that provides space for the audio description. Good example: Extended audio description with separate described video (static image) This example has two versions, the original at 1:53 long, and the audio description at 4:29 long. The longer version displays a static image to allow space for audio description of the visuals. Lyme disease video: How to reduce ticks around your home Good example: Linking to a VTT file from the track element Use the element’s kind='descriptions' and src attributes to designate a descriptions file to load with the video. HTML Code begins Code ends Good example: VTT format for audio description Example begins WEBVTT 00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.880 A man sitting on a park bench takes out treats for his dog. 00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.680 A woman walking her dog waves to the man and stops at the bench. 00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.040 She takes out her own dog treats. 00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.120 The man consults his phone and shows it to the woman.

 content: "  Writing descriptions Many organizations choose to outsource their description. If you are attempting it yourself, bear these tips in mind: Describe the visual elements important to understand what the video is communicating. Describe objectively. Do not interpret, censor or comment. Write in present tense, using an active voice and a third-person narrative style. Include all text, e.g., title text at the beginning, links and email addresses, speaker’s names, and text in a presentation. Transcripts are either static or interactive and timestamped, depending on the design: Static transcripts, unlike audio description, don’t have to fit the description into gaps in the audio. Static descriptions may use as many words as is necessary for clarity. Interactive transcripts use timestamps in the captions and descriptions timed text files to fit descriptions into the gaps in audio of the main video. These descriptions are constrained by the time available and include less detail than descriptions in static transcripts. Alternately, the media player may offer an option to pause the video while descriptions are announced, in which case the descriptions don’t have to fit into the gaps in the audio of the main video.

 content: "  Designing with flashing content Rapidly flashing lights or strobe-like effects in video, graphics or animation can cause photo-epileptic seizures in users with photosensitive epilepsy. Also known as convulsions, these are a sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain that can cause physical harm. Flashing lights can trigger a seizure if: Lights flash more than 3 times per second. The flashing content is large enough. WCAG provides a complex formula here, but the rule of thumb is flashing content larger than 21,824 sq pixels is problematic. As a square, that works out to 148 pixels by 148 pixels: The flashing content has high contrast. WCAG provides another complex formula here, but as an alternative recommends assessing flashing content using a tool such as the Photosensitive Epilepsy Analysis Tool (PEAT). Because users may magnify the page and so enlarge the flashing area, it’s safest to limit the flashing of any size content to no more than three flashes in any 1-second period (Success Criterion 2.3.2: Three Flashes, Level AAA). If you can’t edit the flashing source, don’t use it. Allowing users to turn off the flashing content is not a viable option as the seizure could occur before the user has a chance to act. ",

 content: "  What to transcribe You transcribe all speech and non-speech sounds (laughs, groans, sighs, screams, car backfiring, footsteps approaching, distant roaring). For the most part, the best practices for what to include in captions and transcripts are identical. Differences are noted in the following sections. Identify the speakers. Use the full name the first time and single name otherwise. If a speaker is not identified, use Speaker + number (e.g, Speaker 1, Speaker 2) or use a role/title without a number (e.g., interviewer, Doctor). Include relevant information about the speech. For example, (whispering) Alan: You go first. (mouthing) Ellen: No way. Put non-speech sounds in parenthesis, italics, lowercase, and with a space before and after. For example, ( chatter in distance ) ( sniff ) When a speaker is off-screen, set their speech in italics. For example, Doug: Are you coming? Annie: I’ll be right down. Use punctuation to convey emphasis. For an incredulous question, use a question mark and an exclamation point: Ted: Are you saying we have to start over?! For pauses in speech, use an ellipse: Sheila: We … Yes, we begin tonight. For interrupted speech, use a dash at the end of the line. Any text that follows the interruption should be set on a new line: Ted: We’ll never get -- Use all capital letters only to indicate yelling. For example, Ellen: FORE! When the speech is unintelligible or inaudible, transcribe: [inaudible] Indicate large silences as: (silence) Do not reveal intentionally held information before the appropriate time. Exclude non-relevant speech and non-relevant background noise. Include background music if it’s important to understand the content. Identify music with the uppercase label MUSIC (or a verb implying music), followed by a colon and the title in quotation marks followed by the artist. For example, MUSIC: “Rocket Man” by Elton John CAROL HUMS: “Happy Birthday” BOB WHISTLES: “Take Me Out to Ball Game” Transcribe lyrics if they’re important and set them in italics. With captions, add a musical note to the beginning and end of each. ♪ A long, long time ago ♪ Describe music that’s not part of the action but sets the mood: ♪ scary music ♪ ",

Follow the best practices for writing descriptions (see Description of visual information). Descriptive transcripts may be generated by combining captions and descriptions timed text files (e.g., WebVTT). This is necessary for interactive transcripts. If your transcript is generated from timed text files, descriptions must fit into gaps in the main audio, or the player must provide functionality to pause during the description (see Description of visual information). If your transcript is static, your descriptions do not need to fit into gaps in the audio, and may take as many words as needed for clarity. Transcripts include onscreen text in videos. Captions do not include onscreen text. Transcripts also identify the source of sounds, rather than just describe them. In some cases, such as legal depositions, the transcript must be verbatim, including ums, ahs, and indicating pauses. Headings, topics and links can make the transcript more usable. Here is an example transcript with headings. Here's another example transcript organized by topics in square brackets. Include timestamps only when useful. If you do include them, they don’t need to be as granular as the captions, and don’t need to include end times. This example TED Talk transcript: How technology allowed me to read adds a timestamp to each paragraph in an interactive transcript where the timestamp doubles as a video link. Add a timestamp to inaudible audio. For example, Rebecca: You have one two weeks and [inaudible 1:20:33] to prepare. ",
